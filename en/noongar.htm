      <div class="content">
      <p><i lang="nys">Kaya wandjoo!!</i>Welcome to my Noongar page!!! As a resident of the Australian southwest, I grew up on Noongar land, and I have tried my best to learn about and appreciate the culture of our first people. After living here according to their law for many thousands of years, the arrival of White Europeans, or <i lang="nys">djanga</i>, brutally upended their entire way of life. Despite this invasion, and the often genocidal actions of the settlers and their successive governments, the Noongar have survived and continue to remain on this land, practicing their culture and speaking their language.
      </p>
      <p>On this page I will share some of the results of my research into Noongar history, culture, and especially language, which I have studied intensively from historical sources. It is my wish that my research will be helpful to the Noongar community, residents of the South-West old and new, and anyone else with an interest in the Noongar, and will contribute to the goals of Treaty, Truth, and Reconciliation.
