      <h2>Welcome to Country<br>
	Acknowledgement of Country</h2>
      <p><i><b>What is a Welcome to Country/Acknowledgement of Country?</b></i></p>
      
      <p>
	If you have spent any time in Australia recently, you have probably noticed short speeches made before the start of almost any event, and little statements in pop-ups or at the bottoms of websites: these are what is known as a ‘Welcome to Country’ or ‘Acknowledgement of Country’.</p>

      <p>
	A Welcome to Country and an Acknowledgement of Country are not quite the same thing: they are both intended to pay respects to the traditional owners of the land where something is being done or made, and acknowledge their continued connection to that land, but a Welcome to Country is performed by a member of the traditional owners' group and is a ceremony intended to welcome outsiders to the land, and ask the spirits to ensure their well-being.
      </p>

      <p>
	Welcome to Country ceremonies have become very common at public events in Australia, taking place everywhere from small corporate gatherings to full-scale ceremonies at sporting games and music concerts.
      </p>

      <p>
	When a member of the traditional owner's group is not available, an Acknowledgement of Country may be done instead by anyone, and these are what you will find on this and many other Australian websites. As the name suggests, it is a statement to acknowledge and pay respects, showing an understanding that despite colonization, the First Peoples of Australia still live on their lands and have an unbroken connection to them.
      </p>

      <p>
	It is a small statement made to acknowledge a truth that was until recently often denied, under the myth of ‘Terra Nullius’: the old racist idea that Australia was essentially uninhabited when the Europeans first arrived, and to the extent it was inhabited, the native peoples had no particular connection to or rights over their lands.
      </p>

      <p>
	Acknowledgement of Country is a way of recognizing the true history of Australia, which was a land of many nations long before the White people came, and a gesture towards righting the many wrongs done to First Nations Australians throughout colonization to the present day.
