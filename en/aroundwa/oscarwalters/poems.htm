      <h2>The Poems of Oscar Walters</h2>

      <p>Not long before the pandemic started, I began a project to collect as many of the poems of Oscar Walters as I could find. It was a project that could only have happened thanks to the work of the National Library of Australia Trove — without their easily searchable digitized newspapers, the process of finding the poems below would likely have been agonizingly slow and tedious, which probably goes part of the way to explaining why nobody has done it until now.</p>

      <p>I think I've collected a fair selection of Walters' poems, including the major ones, but I became sidetracked with other projects and never did the planned second sweep to make the collection definitive. This remains a future task to complete.</p>

      <p>The poems are presented below in chronological order, from his earliest published stanza in <cite>The Bulletin</cite> as a teenager in 1908, to his final poem <cite>"When Men to Men...."</cite> published shortly before his death in 1948. I have marked some of my personal favourites with a ★; 'Ken Ray' and 'Shrapnel Green' in particular have always stuck with me.</p>

      <p><i>From <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, November 12<sup>th</sup>, 1908.</i></p>

      <p><q><i>There are exactly seventy-four national poets in Australasia. This page has been almost snowed under with patriotism. Despite the menace of our wrath, The Bulletin has been staggering beneath a fusillade of “Arises,” and “Awakes,” and “Advances,” and quite a large thunderstorm of “Hails.” [...] <br>
	  Unevenness in quality spoiled many a promising Australaise. Here are some good stanzas, picked from songs of inferior make: [...]</i></q></p><br>

      <p>Though our country's large, and our coastline
	long, our people few, our defences small,<br>
	In valor and sentiment we are strong, with freedom we'll live or with freedom fall.<br>
	We fought for our mother in lands afar, and died like heroes at Mammon's nod,<br>
	But fiercer we'll fight in our country's war, when we fight for our homes, our land, our God.

     <a id="How_We_Saved_Australia"><h3>How We Saved Australia</h3></a>

      <p><i>From <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, August 26<sup>th</sup>, 1909.</i></p>


      <p>
	Australia rose in anger,<br>
And then sat down in fear,<br>
When first the cry came surging,<br>
“The flaming Japs are here.”<br>
Then Sosh and anti-Soshite<br>
Joined in a mighty shout,<br>
“Call, ere we all are murdered,<br>
	Our brave boy-soldiers out.”
      </p>

      <p>
Our colonel had been waxing<br>
His whiskers since the dawn;<br>
But the cadets he marshalled<br>
Upon the croquet lawn.<br>
“My lads,” said he unto us,<br>
“Great work is ours to-day;<br>
The whole world’s eyes are on us.”<br>
We loudly said, “’Ooray!”
      </p>

      <p>
There were just fourteen of us —<br>
Bill Smith had hurt his thumb.<br>
His mother wrote explaining<br>
That William couldn’t come.<br>
We shed a tear for Billy<br>
And his ill-timed mishap,<br>
And, ‘midst a blast of cheering,<br>
Went forth to meet the Jap.
      </p>

      <p>
With all due ceremony<br>
We formed a hollow square;<br>
Whatever else was lacking,<br>
The hollowness was there.<br>
Our colonel stood before us;<br>
He smiled a scornful smile<br>
Upon those brown invaders<br>
Who gazed on us the while.
      </p>

      <p>
“Come on!” then loud we shouted,<br>
“O soldiers of Japan.”<br>
They wavered for an instant,<br>
And then in haste they ran<br>
To where their boats were riding<br>
Upon the swelling tide;<br>
And as they climbed aboard them,<br>
“’Ooray! ‘Ooray!” we cried.
      </p>

      <p>
The thirst of blood us urging,<br>
We chased our fleeing foe<br>
Right down unto the ocean,<br>
And sadly watched him go.<br>
Then spake our gallant colonel:<br>
“The sight of us, my men,<br>
Has quite demoralised them;<br>
They’ve gone back home again.”
      </p>

      <p>
Then cityward we carried<br>
Our colonel, shoulder high —<br>
Our pretty, gold-laced colonel,<br>
Who’d sworn to do or die.<br>
And when we met our people,<br>
Oh, how the cheers did ring!<br>
And all joined in together<br>
And sang “God Save the King!”
      </p>

      <p>
They took us to the panto,;<br>
We had a glorious night;<br>
They toasted us in sherbet —<br>
“The heroes of the fight.”<br>
Meanwhile the Japs went rushing<br>
Across the deep blue sea.<br>
‘Twas thus we saved Australia<br>
In the brave days to be.

      <a id="God_and_I"><h3>God and I.</h3></a>

      <p><i>From <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, April 6<sup>th</sup>, 1911.</i></p>

      <p>
	There is one great bond between us that is neither worn nor frayed,<br>
Though He reigns supreme in Heaven and I till the Earth He made;<br>
Though He is the great Creator — I the smallest,
trampled clod,<br>
Yet there is this bond between us — we are weary,
	I and God.
      </p>

      <p>
By the stern Decree of Eden, I must wring from
barren lands<br>
Food for my toil-racked body, whilst He sits with
folded hands;<br>
Low and softly in these ages the celestial choirs do
sing.<br>
For a palace sinks to silence when in slumber lies
the King.
      </p>

      <p>
In the primal days of kingship, so the hoary legend
says,<br>
He created this vast plaything in six mighty
working days;<br>
But the task no doubt distressed Him, and He
sought a life of ease;<br>
Now unheeded spins the plaything through the
careless centuries.
      </p>

      <p>
Now I see the temples totter, and I hear the
chanting cease.<br>
When with those first days of vigor we contrast
this deathly peace;<br>
For the prayer remains unanswered and the weak
and helpless fall,<br>
And the tyrant goes unhindered whilst His fainting servants call.
      </p>

      <p>
And now, having hurled this pebble, to my glasshouse I’ll retire,<br>
To continue my earth labor and reluctantly
perspire;<br>
And I bid you when I perish carve above this
head of mine:<br>
“Yes, he sinned both much and deeply — but his
tiredness was divine.”

      <p><i>From <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, May 15<sup>th</sup>, 1913.</i></p>

      <p><q><i>Sixty entries were received for the competition for a guinea sonnet on the Federal Capital, and of these at
least a dozen were well-wrought and interesting. Exactly half of the sonneteers spoke of Canberra with
enthusiastic or modified appreciation, including one whose enthusiasm ran to 16 lines; the other half of
	    the sonneteers sang more in anger than in sorrow. Perhaps, after all, Oscar Walters is right: —</i></q></p><br>

      <p>
	There is no Federal Capital, no theme<br>
For eager sonneteers to work upon.<br>
There is no budding, teeming Babylon<br>
in that weird village by the Cotter’s stream.<br>
The fulsome speech and psalm dispel our dream;<br>
The city that our hopes were builded on<br>
Has been to us forbidden, and is gone,<br>
	And petty interests mock our fruitless scheme.
      </p>

      <p>
But we, we still must dream, and still we see,<br>
Beyond parochialism’s dreary slough<br>
The shining city we cannot forget.<br>
But, oh, the way is wearying, and we<br>
Are sorely harassed; I can only know<br>
The time for sonneteering is not yet.

      <a id="Our_Little_Mates"><h3>Our Little Mates.</h3></a>
      <p><i>From <cite>The Meekatharra Miner</cite>, June 10<sup>th</sup>, 1916</i></p>

      <p><q><i>Sapper Oscar Walters, who was secretary of the Sandstone Branch of the A.W.A., enlisted from there and
is now “somewhere at the front,” recently received a letter from his mother, in which she wrote: “Alan
dreamt last night that he was at the war with you. He was your little mate.”
	    In one of his letters Oscar writes:</i></q></p><br>

      <p>
	It was for a short time only that all of our schemes
seemed wrecked,<br>
That we had forsaken our dearest to earn
a foe’s respect.<br>
And dully we watched the sun set in a
world of blood and hate,<br>
When in our blunted senses stole the
	dream of a Little Mate.
      </p>

      <p>
And they who were faint and weary in
the long, grim fight with pain<br>
Smiled at your fanciful dreaming, and
smiling, took heart again<br>
“Dear Little Mate, do you blame us if
we, when the fight was hot,<br>
Slaughtered and gazed at the slaughter,
and slaughtering, forgot?”
      </p>

      <p>
No longer with feet uncertain we travel a
path unknown;<br>
Fearless we face a morrow we dared not
face alone.<br>
Out on the lone, grim places ever on
guard we stand,<br>
That your dreaming be unmolested — that
your dreams be large and grand.
      </p>

      <p>
For you fight with us in the trenches, you
walk with us in the snows,<br>
You go with us on the long fatigues that
only a soldier knows.<br>
When we fight for you in the darkness, in
the darkness you fight with us<br>
In the hell that we have created; the gods
have ordained it thus.
      </p>

      <p>
We have little of goodness and wisdom,
we pawns in the hands of Fate.<br>
We have sinned as man can only, yet each
has a Little Mate<br>
Who gives him the greater courage in the
game of the desperate chance,<br>
‘Tis the Little Mates who will lead us on
in the days of the great advance.

      <p><i>From the <cite>Westralian Worker</cite>, April 27<sup>th</sup>, 1917.</i></p>

      <p><q><i>Oscar Walters, late secretary Sandstone Miners, now in France</i></q></p><br>

      <p>
	Dull as the days of mid-winter, heavy
and languid as time;<br>
Drear is the lot of the sapper, marooned in an ocean of slime,<br>
Dreaming of days that have vanished,
hoping for better to come,<br>
Only to action awakening when the section clerk issues the rum.
      </p>

      <p>
Arguments rise in a moment in this
muddiest corner of France;<br>
And sappers rush to the conflict with
the valor of ignorance,<br>
Into arguments wild and whirling, into arguments futile and vain<br>
He rushes with wild assertions, and
an air of high disdain.
      </p>

      <p>
The High Seas Fleet is demolished!
and Hughes gets particular hell!<br>
The I Won’t Works are exalted, when
Inglis is going well;<br>
And Murray with ringing curses, impartial and calm as fate<br>
Curses the whole damn outfit, in his
evening Hymn of Hate.
      </p>

      <p>
Can a template be called a pattern?
Is a high wall built or made?<br>
Was Hamlet as mad as a soldier?
Should a shovel be called a spade?<br>
Is Asquith a dinkum statesman? — and
should America fight?<br>
Ask of the third field sapper, and he
will set you right.
      </p>

      <p>
We dream of a good time coming — of
beer, and of cleared skies,<br>
When Orchard has left his stiffness,
and McGregor won’t dogmatise.<br>
When we won’t have to duck from the
shrapnel, we won’t give a dam
for the dud<br>
Pity the sapper who argues, marooned
in an ocean of mud.

      <p><i>From the <cite>Murchison Times and Day Dawn Gazette</cite>, September 07<sup>th</sup>, 1917</i></p>

      <p>
	In the days when the world was younger,
in the days when our faith was
whole,<br>
We watched with eyes of hunger, the
pageant of life unrol.<br>
We knelt at the shrine of beauty – our
homage we gave to truth.<br>
We were Lords, for a moment only, in
	the wonderful court of youth.
      </p>

      <p>
And in our world, of beauty, dimming our
joyous song,<br>
The War God awoke from his slumber,
and smote on his burnished gong.<br>
And the days of our freedom vanished,
our world in pieces was rent.<br>
The War God called us to battle, and
the youth to the slaughter went.
      </p>

      <p>
We have followed him where he has led
us, we have needed his high commands,<br>
With fear in our hearts and anguish, and
death in our weary hands.<br>
We have slaved in the sands of the
desert — we have toiled in the dust
and the heat.<br>
We have followed the path of glory,
through the snow, and the mud, and
the sleet.
      </p>

      <p>
We have fought in the fiercest of battles
since ever the world began.<br>
We have rotted in mud in the trenches,
for of such is the madness of man.<br>
We are weary of horror and travail — of
death – and we would forget,<br>
But the guns still flash in the darkness,
and the War God calls us yet.
      </p>

      <p>
In the days when the world was younger,
in the days when our faith was
whole,<br>
We watched with eyes of hunger, the
pageant of life unrol.<br>
We knelt at the shrine of beauty; and
while we were bowing the knee,<br>
We were sold to the god of battles — to
anguish and misery!

      <p><q>We are powerless before the menace of Moscow and the Reds.</q> — Anguished Tories.</p><br>

      <p>
	Our days are full of sorrow now,<br>
Our nights are full of woe,<br>
Our dash is done, we sadly bow<br>
	Before the latest foe.
      </p>

      <p>
We who of old none dared deride<br>
Now shiver in our beds —<br>
Demoralized and terrified<br>
By Moscow and the Reds.
      </p>

      <p>
Yet there were days that bought us fame<br>
When well we held our ground;<br>
Though Socialistic Tigers came<br>
And growled and prowled around:<br>
But now our arms are palsied, while<br>
The menace swiftly spreads,<br>
Abetted by the agents vile<br>
Of Moscow and the Reds.
      </p>

      <p>
How gallantly we took our stand<br>
In those brave days gone by;<br>
We saved the Home from Ruin and<br>
We saved the Marriage Tie.<br>
And Labor upstarts swiftly hid<br>
Their sore, diminished heads;<br>
But now we do as we are bid<br>
By Moscow and the Reds.
      </p>

      <p>
With bayonets fixed, the bags we hopped,<br>
Our earnings to defend;<br>
We routed every foe and stopped<br>
The Socialistic Trend;<br>
And we were very swift to save<br>
The Empire’s Silken Threads —<br>
But now, the wrath we dare not brave<br>
Of Moscow and the Reds.
      </p>

      <p>
So must we live, so must we bleed,<br>
Without a ray of hope,<br>
Until there is no longer need<br>
For this election dope:<br>
And I, although tormented with<br>
A hundred thousand dreads,<br>
Bless the inventor of the myth<br>
Of Moscow and the Reds.

      <p><i>From the <cite>Westralian Worker</cite>, October 19<sup>th</sup>, 1923.</i></p>

      <p>“As the train made its final run . . . a big rainbow . . . tried hard to plant its foot on the train in token of
	benison and blessing on the vice-regal pair.” - (By Our Representative) “West Australian,” 24/9/23.</p><br>

      <p>
	My head keeps on swelling and swelling,<br>
And I fear that my passing draws nigh,<br>
But my tears I’m courageously quelling,<br>
For it’s in a good cause that I die.<br>
Folk will say, when my spirit has started<br>
Away to the Isles of Blest,<br>
He was one of the band that imparted<br>
	A “litery” tone to the “West.”
      </p>

      <p>
With Morrison busily typing<br>
A screed of discernment and weight,<br>
Or Murdoch belatedly piping<br>
A piece from the Hymnal of Hate,<br>
With “Faithful” and “Scrutator” hustling<br>
Along the broad highway of fame,<br>
I often was lost in the bustling,<br>
But I seized on my chance, when it came.
      </p>

      <p>
Where the groupers are merrily grouping<br>
And the tall timber reaches the sky,<br>
There I proved (if you’ll pardon my whooping)<br>
The things I could do, should I try.<br>
There, amid all the bustle and clutter<br>
Of engines, and horses, and men,<br>
I felt in my bosom a flutter,<br>
And the ink gurgled up in my pen.
      </p>

      <p>
Then, I knew ‘twas my moment of glory;<br>
I took it, but, ah me, the cost.<br>
And that is the end of my story,<br>
But I look on the world as well lost;<br>
For my readers will ever remember<br>
The claim to immortality.<br>
That was made on that day in September<br>
By the Rainbow, the Forsters, and Me.

      <p><i>From the <cite>Westralian Worker</cite>, November 9<sup>th</sup>, 1923.</i></p>

      <p>He sat beside me at the play,<br>
Where all the world seemed bright,<br>
And that which filled me with dismay<br>
Aroused his shrill delight;<br>
He saw the players rant and strut<br>
In mock sincerity;<br>
He followed all their frothings, but —<br>
	He missed the tragedy!
      </p>

      <p>
The play and players all awry<br>
He voted a success,<br>
And gave them greetings gay, while I<br>
Saw but their littleness;<br>
He saw the humour of their gibes,<br>
The reason of the hates,<br>
Applauded Massey’s diatribes<br>
And Bruce’s postulates.
      </p>

      <p>
The while the players beat the air<br>
They held his heart in thrall,<br>
He could not see the black despair<br>
That lay behind it all:<br>
The paltry scheme, the mean device,<br>
The efforts to misguide,<br>
Nor feel the useless sacrifice<br>
Of manhood, faith, and pride.
      </p>

      <p>
My neighbour’s laughter jarred, and so<br>
I turned away from him;<br>
And then, despite the limelight glow,<br>
I saw the stage grow dim;<br>
I saw again a shot-torn wood,<br>
I heard the shrieking shell,<br>
And felt again the brotherhood<br>
That blossomed there in hell.
      </p>

      <p>
The futile players I forgot,<br>
Their paltry hopes and fears,<br>
For I was back where dead men rot<br>
Through all the rotten years.<br>
The world they saw through war’s red haze,<br>
I looked on once again,<br>
I lived again in the brave days<br>
Of those who died in vain.
      </p>

      <p>
Then from a silent grassy mound,<br>
That I shall ne’er forget,<br>
I turned unto my friend and found<br>
That he was cackling yet;<br>
I could not stand his laughter shrill,<br>
And eager to be gone,<br>
I turned and left the scene where still<br>
The players piffled on.
      </p>

      <p>
O tortured, murdered mates of old!<br>
O glorious fellowship!<br>
Your story briefly now is told<br>
In Shylock’s tightened grip.<br>
The end of all your bravery,The sum of each great deed,<br>
But dug the grave of honesty,<br>
And saved the world for greed!
      </p>

      <p>
Your dreams are o’er, your glory pales,<br>
Your splendours disappear;<br>
Now triumphs greed, yet what avails<br>
The useless bitter tear?<br>
Here, where the players make their din,<br>
Here, I, in sorrow find<br>
The world’s great tragedy within<br>
The plaudits of the blind.

      <p><i>From the <cite>Westralian Worker</cite>, December 7<sup>th</sup>, 1923.</i></p>

      <p>The votaries of blither air<br>
Their wondrous views on that, and this,<br>
Each day the chorus swells, but there<br>
Remains one voice we ever miss.<br>
We have the never-ending song<br>
Of Bruce, and Baldwin, and the rest;<br>
But never breaks for us the long,<br>
	Deep silence of the dispossessed.
      </p>

      <p>
The horns of empire bravely blow,<br>
And Mammon’s hirelings glibly prate;<br>
The tides of guff unceasing flow,<br>
With every fool articulate.<br>
The bawling patriot’s breast expands,<br>
The “True Imperial Note” is stressed,<br>
But, through the maddening riot stands<br>
The silence of the dispossessed.
      </p>

      <p>
Silent, amid a world of noise;<br>
Of empty boasting, greed, and lies;<br>
Dumb, while the “patriot” employs<br>
His slogans and his battlecries.<br>
Voiceless, while Truth and Justice sleep,<br>
While Faith is banned and meanness
blest;<br>
No prayers, no tears disturb the deep,<br>
Long silence of the dispossessed.
      </p>

      <p>
And yet, somehow, we dream that we<br>
Shall see the tides of blither cease.<br>
That Mammon, some day, will not be<br>
Sole arbiter of war and peace.<br>
And hear from an awakened throng,<br>
With all their strength made manifest,<br>
The burning words that end the long,<br>
Deep silence of the dispossessed.
      </p>

      <p>
But still we hear the anthems trolled,<br>
Still pomp reclines in god-like ease,<br>
Still Mammon’s clutching talons hold<br>
The plunder of the centuries.<br>
And still the jingo’s breast dilates,<br>
And scheming loyalists infest<br>
A weary world, that still awaits<br>
The murmurs of the dispossessed.

      <a id="The_Blankards"><h3>The Blankards Scratched Him Off</h3></a>

      <p><i>From the <cite>Westralian Worker</cite>, January 4<sup>th</sup>, 1924.</i></p>

      <p>The electoral rolls close almost immediately. Persons whose names do not appear are liable to
prosecution and on conviction to the payment of a heavy fine. This poem describes the position of an
	elector whose name has been removed from the roll, and who never bothered to see about his rights.</p><br>

      <p>In the peaceful hush that follows on the finish of the fray,<br>
When the shouts and cheers are over, and the tumult dies away,<br>
Comes the usual beery person, we have learned to know so well.<br>
With the froth still on his whiskers and a tale of woe to tell.<br>
Ah, too well we know that person with his air of mystery,<br>
Who proclaims himself the victim of a dark conspiracy;<br>
And it’s always safe to wager that the next election night<br>
Will bring out that dreary person, with his endless blatherskite,<br>
And he’ll fix you with his optic, and with many a sad hic-cough:<br>
	“I was on the roll,” he’ll tell you, “but the blankards scratched me off!”
      </p>

      <p>
“Yes, me lad,” the fraud will tell you, “in the days when men were men,<br>
We was always busy battlin’ for the Cause of Labor then;<br>
It was us that put the toiler on the road to liberty:<br>
There’d have been no Labor Party but for dinkum blokes like me.<br>
It was us that built the platform; it was us laid down the planks;<br>
And we never asked for nothing, and we never got no thanks;<br>
In the days that I remember, men were dinkum through and through;<br>
But them days have gone forever, with the dinkum men and true;<br>
We was always persecuted, we was always victimised,<br>
But we always hung together, for the cause we idolized;<br>
And the bloody-handed despots, they were scared of us, you bet;<br>
And I’ve seen the signs in plenty that they ain’t forgot us yet.<br>
And it shows I ain’t forgotten by the tyrant and the toff,<br>
I was on the roll, young feller, but the blankards scratched me off!”
      </p>

      <p>
So they spill their tiresome twaddle, so they ramble on and on,<br>
Of the good men long departed and the glories that have gone.<br>
They grow maudlin’ o’er their pewters, as they tell of stratagem,<br>
Plot, and scheme, and machination, that is still pursuing them.<br>
And they claim our admiration for their perspicacity,<br>
Though they were so busy skiting, that they had no time to see<br>
There was one thing that mattered more than all the tales they told,<br>
And that was – a fool could see it – just to get their names enrolled!<br>
And the moral of this jingle, well I guess it’s pretty plain,<br>
If you’d do your best for Labor, go at once and ascertain<br>
If your name is where it should be, and you’ll thus avoid the scoff<br>
That should greet the folk who whimper that “the blankards scratched them off.”

      <p>“There is an awakening abroad in the land.” - Mr. Collier, Leader of the Labor Party.<p><br>

	<p>Low in the west the red sky burns,<br>
The long, hot, weary day is done;<br>
And from his task the toiler turns<br>
	  To watch the setting of the sun.
	</p>

	<p>
His back is straight, the eyes are bright<br>
That shine beneath the sheltering hand,<br>
As, at long last, he sees the light<br>
That never was on sea or land.
	</p>

	<p>
Upon his brow he feels the breeze —<br>
The freshening breeze of liberty;<br>
And, for a splendid moment, sees<br>
The glorious world that is to be.
	</p>

	<p>
He feels his strength, the strength to rend;<br>
He has the knowledge to attain:<br>
He knows that he alone can end,<br>
His long, long pilgrimage of pain.
	</p>

	<p>
No more beneath his heavy load,<br>
With aching back, and feet that bleed,<br>
Shall he go toiling up the road,<br>
The helpless slave of grab, and greed.
	</p>

	<p>
Long has he journeyed. Ah! the long<br>
Dead centuries his anguish knows —<br>
The chafing shackle and the thong,<br>
The want, the weariness, and woe.
	</p>

	<p>
At last awake! erect at last!<br>
No more to black despair a prey.<br>
Out of the misty blood-stained past<br>
He steps into the larger day.

Am I my brother’s keeper? I<br>
Who spurned this clod, and mocked

      <p>The shore-line rose into our ken<br>
Beneath a golden dome,<br>
But we were sad and tired men,<br>
The day that we came home;<br>
We saw the mates we knew of old —<br>
Betrayed, and tricked, and fooled —<br>
We heard the endless stories told<br>
	By sooler and by sooled.
      </p>

      <p>
We listened to their tales, and then<br>
In bitterness, I said:<br>
“There’s peace at least for tired men<br>
Among the quiet dead;<br>
On Picard fields we never knew<br>
Such hate and agony,<br>
And better had we stayed” — then you —<br>
You smiled and turned to me.

“Stand by the fellowship,” you said,<br>
“And let the crowd go by.<br>
These empty creeds will soon be dead,<br>
And stilled their battle-cry;<br>

“While stands the fellowship, shall stand<br>
The courage to endure;<br>
While man shall grip his fellow’s hand,<br>

Upon the Jingo’s lip,<br>
Shall swiftly pass,” you said, “and I<br>
Stand by the fellowship.

The wreath upon the Jingo’s brow<br>
Is falling to decay;<br>
The “patriot’s” cry is fainter now,<br>
His hour slips fast away;<br>
In vain the nets are spread, in vain<br>
Shall greed display her lures,<br>
In weal and woe, in joy and pain,<br>
The fellowship endures.
      </p>

      <p>
And we who faltered in the night,<br>
How can we now repay<br>
The men who turned towards the light<br>
And kept the faith always?<br>

Let us be true, and we<br>
Shall make the brotherhood of man<br>

      <p>Mr. Bruce declared that no thinking person could challenge the statement that the issues with which
Australia was confronted were probably the most serious that any democratic people could be called upon
	to decide.</p><br>

      <p>The days are filled with riotings;<br>

And every hour fresh trouble brings<br>
	In these tremendous times.

The vastness of this period.<br>
With awe our bosoms fill;<br>
And dull indeed must be the clod<br>
Who cannot feel a thrill.

The “reds” are prowling up and
down<br>
The wrath of hell to raise;<br>
And there’s no rest in field or town<br>
In these stupendous days.

This is the hour! but language fails,<br>
And I cannot express<br>

Just watch the Tory press!

      <p>Oh, north and south our boundaries run, and like-
wise east and west,<br>
Their limitations fill with joy the smug parochial
breast.<br>
The while my memory wanders back to other days
than these<br>
When there were men who looked beyond our foolish
	boundaries.
      </p>

      <p>
They did not ladle out to us the sorry parish pap;<br>
They did not bow them low before the inkmarks on
the map;<br>
They did not strive to catch us at our meanest and
our worst;<br>
But (was it in their ignorance?) they put Australia
first!
      </p>

      <p>
Theirs were the thoughts a continent, flung far
and wide, inspires;<br>
But there are those to-day who only think in States
or shires.<br>
What do they care if they can pose as captain of
the ship,<br>
Their own poor paltry little barque — and let Australia
rip?
      </p>

      <p>
It may be they were not so shrewd, those men
whose voices cried<br>
Of old; they’d simple seem to-day who poor so often
died.<br>
The faith they held would but evoke derision now,
or mirth,<br>
But it may be Australia yet will realise their worth.
      </p>

      <p>
For far beyond the parish pump they saw their
splendid goal;<br>
They looked into the future and they saw Australia
whole.<br>
Some still their inspiration draw from these long-
vanished men.<br>
There was a vision once. Who knows? — it may
return again.
      </p>

      <p>
But east and west our boundaries run, and likewise
north and south.<br>
Things to regard with awe-filled eyes, and widely
gaping mouth.<br>
Grim boundaries and border lines that never shall
be crossed<br>
Unless we chance to find again the vision that is
	lost.</p>

So free is getting low;<br>
Ere heavier scores we’re owing<br>

It shameful seems and sinful<r>

Glad were the years of borrow,<br>

Our gaze is on our glasses,<br>
But his is on the slate.

A worried lot and wearied<br>
Are those who’re apt to find<br>

With emphasis unkind.<br>

Our name will soon be Mud,<br>
The chucker-out is nearing,<br>
	The jag has come a thud.

      <p><i>From <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, November 4<sup>th</sup>, 1926.</i></p>

      <p>Come put those tiresome lists away and let those
letters wait;<br>
To higher thoughts and nobler deeds to-day is dedicate.<br>
To lesser men than you or I the reins of office throw;<br>
To-day we ride, old mates of mine, into the long
	ago.
      </p>

      <p>
Too long have we been cramped for space, too narrow
are the ways<br>
That we have trodden, comrades true, for many
weary days.<br>
So let us saddle and begone where all the world is
free,<br>
And we care not how far we go — if we get back for tea.
      </p>

      <p>
For men were men when we were young and mates
were mates in sooth<br>
That struck through toils and perils quite unknown
to modern youth<br>
(Ah me, I often wonder what those pretty boys
would do<br>
Had they to face the hardships that we faced in
‘ninety-two!).
      </p>

      <p>
So let us off and once again along the Castlereagh<br>
We’ll do the deeds and sing the songs you never
hear to-day.<br>
We’ll leave those petty things and find within the
camp-fire’s glow<br>
The glory and the splendor of the days of long ago.
      </p>

      <p>
What memories will waken when we ride along the
track<br>
To further out, and further on, to bring the old
days back!<br>
We’ll meet the friends of other days and tell them
of our quest,<br>
And swap the good old jokes again, the jokes that
stood the test.
      </p>

      <p>
So forward, gallant mates of mine, for restive grow
our steeds.<br>
Come let us mount, and give the world the lesson
that it needs.<br>
What matters your increase of girth, it will not
take us long<br>
To prove that we are always right, and others always
wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
And yet – yet there is a doubt; it may be, after
all,<br>
Far better to remain at home, lest we ride for a
fall.<br>
It may be best to merely state we’re made of
sterner stuff,<br>
And pray whatever gods may be that no one calls
our bluff.

      <p>“Our primary products are dependent upon people of other countries, whose products the Protectionist
	would exclude in order that he may prey upon the Australian people.” - Perth Sunday Times.</p><br>

      <p>We’ve lived through anxious days before, we’ve
lived through nights of dread,<br>
When black despair and misery accompanied us to
bed,<br>
But never knew such hopelessness as fills our hearts
to-day —<br>
The wily, smooth Protectionist has marked us for
	his prey!
      </p>

      <p>
How base is the Protectionist! He won’t respect
the creed<br>
That Cobden gave the waiting world — he tries with
word and deed<br>
To shatter and destroy our faith, to spoil and disaffect,<br>
To take from us our humbleness and make us
stand erect.
      </p>

      <p>
And we who have but one desire, to take our lowly
wage<br>
And go our servile way beneath the Old World’s
patronage,<br>
Are sick and sad when we behold each pitfall and
each snare<br>
He sets for us, and so we cry “Oh fellow-serfs,
beware!”
      </p>

      <p>
Not in ourselves our trust we place, for thereby
we offend<br>
The folk who live across the sea, upon whom we
depend.<br>
For independence is a state to which we don’t
aspire<br>
While foreign sweat-shops sell us cheap whatever we desire.
      </p>

      <p>
Oh wicked, base Protectionist, we’re tumbled to
your game....<br>
And here we voice a fervent prayer that others do
the same.<br>
Go, leave us our servility! Great Cobden, guard
us all!<br>
Let no one make us stand erect; we are but fit
	to crawl.

	architecture in the Dominions. There are special sections for Australia and Maoriland.”</p><br>

      <p>While British Architects discuss,<br>
And seeds of culture proudly sow,<br>
I see beyond their learned fuss<br>
A house I knew long, long ago.<br>
No trace of it to-day you’ll find,<br>
And that is well; it would have wrecked<br>
For evermore, the peace of mind<br>
	Of every British Architect.
      </p>

      <p>
‘Twas in the ancient days when flats<br>
And kitchenettes were quite unknown;<br>
Ere bonnets gave their place to hats,<br>
And ankles were but seldom shown;<br>
Ere came the paltry side that crabs<br>
And sends the thoughts of men askew,<br>
Dad felled the trees, and split the slabs,<br>
And set the posts up straight and true.
      </p>

      <p>
He did not work by rule of thumb,<br>
Such method enterprise destroys;<br>
He took some small advice from mum,<br>
And some assistance from the boys.<br>
He knew the job he had to do<br>
And steadfastly he went his way,<br>
Not knowing of, and unknown to,<br>
The pundits of the R.I.A.
      </p>

      <p>
Though he had moments of despair<br>
When difficulties seemed to swell<br>
The load too large for him to bear,<br>
He had his victories as well.<br>
For when on winter nights the blaze<br>
Sent out to us its generous heat,<br>
There was no need of learned praise<br>
To make his recompense complete.
      </p>

      <p>
And we — beneath that roof we grew,<br>
And gave no thought to its design,<br>
Through all the years we never knew<br>
It lacked a dignity of line.<br>
And in the days that swiftly came,<br>
How ever far we chanced to roam,<br>
To us it ever was the same,<br>
A place we simply knew as home.
      </p>

      <p>
The world each day more learned grows,<br>
Fresh triumphs man each day achieves,<br>
And he grows wiser, I suppose,<br>
With all the knowledge he receives.<br>
So it may be the modern lad<br>
Who ponders o’er his weighty tome<br>
Could build a better house than Dad,<br>
But who could build a better home?

Move with alacrity.<br>

As statesmen staid and sober<br>
This question they’ll decide;<br>
So it may be October<br>

For if the grey clouds close in<br>
You will not see our chosen<br>
Wet through and damn-near frozen<br>
By swift Molonglo’s side.

They are not built for seizing<br>
The tide while it’s at flood,<br>

They’ll keep the home fires burning<br>
Until the spring returning<br>
Has taught the twigs to bud.

And though dissatisfaction<br>
Its mean appearance makes,<br>

      <p>Where the camp-fire stabs the darkness and the bushmen congregate,<br>
Where the talk goes up from horses to the high affairs

It is there you’ll find the members of a stern
and serious push,<br>
	It’s a quite distinguished Order: The Men Who Know The Bush.
      </p>

      <p>
Doesn’t matter what the fuel – mulga, mallee, jarrah,
gum —<br>
Doesn’t matter where you’re going, doesn’t matter
whence you’ve come,<br>
Be they navvies, shearers, splitters ranged within
the camp-fire’s light,<br>
You can bet on finding someone who can always put
you right.
      </p>

      <p>
Round the camp-fires of the Bushland when the
hours of toil are done<br>
All the “special inside stories,” as the papers say,
are spun.<br>
It is there you, meek and humble, pay the homage
Truth exacts,<br>
As you hear the proper version from a man who
knows the facts.
      </p>

      <p>
There you learn the tale you cherish and the yarn
that you repeat<br>
Is a gross exaggeration, or in all things incomplete.<br>
Age itself is not respected; there’s no pity shown
to youth,<br>
For the camp-fire of the Bushland is the altar-fire of
Truth.
      </p>

      <p>
There the bards and story-writers are put firmly in
their place,<br>
For the Bushman at the camp-fire feels in duty bound
to trace<br>
Incidents they stated wrongly, facts important that
they hid —<br>
Ah! they all know more than Lawson, more than Banjo ever did.
      </p>

      <p>
Round the camp-fires of Australia they are sitting
night by night<br>
Building, blasting reputations, sorting out, and
setting right;<br>
And as long as sparks fly upward, and as long as
camp-fires glow,<br>
There will never be a shortage of the men who
know they know.
      </p>

      <p>
And we who’re sure of nothing, and who view all
things with doubt,<br>
Well for us if we could follow these grand men of
Further Out,<br>
Could we find such faith as they have, could we
emulate that push;<br>
The great everlasting Order of the Liars of the
Bush.

      <p>One summer-time in Eden<br>
(The date is in dispute)<br>
Saw Adam busy weedin’<br>
And Eve preserving fruit.<br>
For they, too, viewed with rapture<br>
The possibilities;<br>
They, too, were out to capture<br>
	The market overseas.
      </p>

      <p>
The pumpkin patch they tended,<br>
They trained the sportive vine;<br>
Its wild career they ended<br>
And brought it into line.<br>
They turned the sour crab-apple<br>
From its mistaken ways;<br>
They saw the melon dapple<br>
Beneath the summer rays.
      </p>

      <p>
Since each and every daytime<br>
Was filled with thoughts of gain,<br>
They took the hours of playtime<br>
From Abel and from Cain.<br>
For childhood there’s no rapture,<br>
For childhood there’s no ease,<br>
With parents out to capture<br>
The market overseas.
      </p>

      <p>
With glad anticipation<br>
They sped the parting boat;<br>
But only desolation<br>
Came with the agent’s note;<br>
In language brief and stark it<br>
Told (Eve sat white and still)<br>
That glutted was the market<br>
And their returns were nil.
      </p>

      <p>
Then was it Cain slew Abel<br>
With an imported axe;<br>
The serpent told his fable,<br>
And “morals became lax”<br>
(That’s how the papers put it);<br>
And then, as you’ve supposed,<br>
They “got the oil” to foot it —<br>
The mortgagee foreclosed.
      </p>

      <p>
The higher criticism —<br>
And possibly the low —<br>
Views otherwise the schism<br>
In Eden long ago.<br>
But while the points they treasure<br>
Seem nowhere to agree,<br>
This has at least a measure<br>
Of probability.
      </p>

      <p>
	For men still view with rapture<br>
	The possibilities:<br>
Men still seek out to capture<br>
The market overseas;<br>
And in that vain endeavor<br>
Still childhood is betrayed,<br>
And ever and for ever<br>
	The tragedy is played.
      </p>

      <p>
The moral (canines bark it):<br>
There’s nothing in “the land”<br>

      <p><i>From <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, January 27<sup>th</sup>, 1927.</i></p>

      We held our posts on the Blighty fronts; we kept
off the fierce attacks<br>
When the medical boards put on their stunts; we
held our own with the jacks.<br>
But there was a fly in our glass of bliss — our yarns
they were old and stale,<br>
And the three of us were alike in this: we knew
      nothing of Passchendaele.
      </p>

      <p>
From Shrapnel Gully to Moquet Farm the whole of
the game we knew,<br>
And we told our tales, and we saw no harm if the
tales were partly true.<br>
But swift time passes; we could not fail to see that
the end had come,<br>
For the reos were talking of Passchendaele, and the
three of us must sit dumb.
      </p>

      <p>
And Bill expounded, and Jim agreed, and I in my
place concurred<br>
That our position was wrong indeed, and likewise
most absurd.<br>
“These reinstoushments,” said Bill with heat and
some words that I could not pen,<br>
“With their modern stories have got us beat, and
it’s us for the Front again.”
      </p>

      <p>
So we had a final go with the jacks — a glorious go —
and thus<br>
Aware of our prowess at last the quacks had a final
go with us;<br>
A wangled leave for a final fling — it was won by a
well-worn tale —<br>
And then away to the Front to bring fresh stories
from Passchendaele!
      </p>

      <p>
And there wasn’t a doubt amongst the three — a bit
of a flutter, and then<br>
Our papers marked with a B2B, the Strand and
the girls again!<br>
“There,” Bill declaimed, “we shall meet anon,” and
we joyfully said “You bet!”....<br>
But the years have come, and the years have gone,
and the Strand is waiting yet.
      </p>

      <p>
Old Jim — he’s making a brave pretence that he is
the same man still,<br>
But it isn’t an earthly audience that’s listening now
to Bill.<br>
And one of his sorrows of to-day, I’ll bet, if sorrows his
peace assail,<br>
Is that he failed when he tried to get a story of
Passchendaele.

      <p>When some act of childish folly in the years now
far away<br>
Filled my heart with consternation, and my mentors
with dismay,<br>
There was one thing ne’er omitted when in judgment
they would sit:<br>
Just the hope that I’d know better when I’d knocked
	about a bit.
      </p>

      <p>
And I’d hear the old men talking, and the men not
very old,<br>
And I’d never fail to gather from the stirring tales
they told<br>
That a man, however fashioned, couldn’t hope to
hold his ground<br>
In an argument or tussle if he hadn’t knocked around.
      </p>

      <p>
Though it’s far that I have travelled from those
days of long ago,<br>
And I’ve never met with wisdom, and it’s little that
I know,<br>
By the things I can remember and the things I can’t
forget,<br>
It is plain to me I haven’t knocked about enough as
yet.
      </p>

      <p>
On the highways and the byways I have journeyed
far and wide,<br>
And there still are roads to travel, and there still
are tracks untried,<br>
And although my faith is shaken in the things the
old men said,<br>
Something precious may be waiting round the bend
that’s just ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
Though it’s little I have gathered, and it’s little I
have gained,<br>
And perhaps my tramp I’ll finish my objective
unattained,<br>
Though I’ve done the things I should not, left undone
the things I should,<br>
And not yet encountered wisdom, I have found the
quest is good.
      </p>

      <p>
And what though I haven’t tasted of the triumph
and defeat<br>
In the turmoil of the market, and the flurry of the
street,<br>
While the sunrise is my partner and the sunset is
my friend,<br>
Though I haven’t gathered riches who’ll be richer
in the end?
      </p>

      <p>
When I get by old St. Peter, if I know enough for
that,<br>
Not for any shining halo will I swap my battered
hat;<br>
With the cherubims a-singing I’ll have little time to sit,<br>
And — well, Heaven won’t be Heaven if I can’t
knock round a bit.

      <p>“It moves!” Of that there is never a doubt.<br>
Before the onset old ways must go;<br>
When Progress marches his legions out<br>
Then we must follow him, whether or no.<br>
Oft sadly shaken and sorely hit,<br>
Still Time, the healer, may reconcile<br>
Us all to the law that has now seen fit<br>
	To close the pub at the Ninety Mile.
      </p>

      <p>
When thick was the dust that the shakers made<br>
Ere the stampers fell on the golden ore,<br>
When the sly-grog shops did a roaring trade<br>
In the care-free days we shall know no more,<br>
With Claypan Jimmy and Paddy the Dog<br>
As our wise mentors we moved in style<br>
On the path of Progress to better grog<br>
In the new tin pub at the Ninety Mile.
      </p>

      <p>
The shakers are few on the flat to-day,<br>
In their rusty boxes the stampers rest;<br>
Still dreaming of riches, some greybeards stay —<br>
It is death alone that shall end their quest.<br>
But they will sit in the bar no more,<br>
Telling old tales with a quiet smile;<br>
For the law in its wisdom has closed the door<br>
Of the old tin pub at the Ninety Mile.
      </p>

      <p>
The law is wise, and the law is just,<br>
And the march of Progress no man can stay;<br>
Though the shakers rot and the stampers rust<br>
It still is marching by night and day.<br>
“No longer needed!” the law declared —<br>
Of facts and figures it quoted a pile;<br>
But yet we think that it might have spared<br>
The old tin pub at the Ninety Mile.

      <p><i>From <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1927</i></p>

      <p>Where once a hundred shakers stood<br>
In days that long have passed away,<br>
When life was free and life was good,<br>
A lonely shaker stands to-day.<br>
And from the riders on the fence<br>
And from the mailman one may catch<br>
A laugh and jest at the expense<br>
	Of Barmy Joe of Grogan’s Patch.
      </p>

      <p>
On Grogan’s Patch when we were young<br>
And cared not what went on the slate,<br>
No debt could worry us who flung<br>
A laughing challenge back to Fate.<br>
We drank and jested, toiled and fought,<br>
And when at last the gold was done<br>
We sought, but ‘twas in vain we sought,<br>
The lode that shed the gold we’d won.
      </p>

      <p>
The tide of life must onward flow,<br>
Hope will not let her victims stay,<br>
And lonely are the winds that blow<br>
O’er far off Grogan’s Patch to-day.<br>
But ‘midst the tailings heaps we reared<br>
When life for us still held a thrill.<br>
By many a long hot summer seared,<br>
Old Barmy Joe is searching still.
      </p>

      <p>
He asks and gets no company,<br>
But far across the burning sands<br>
The stockmen and the mailmen see<br>
A shaker rocked by feeble hands.<br>
Yet though he in the lore is wise,<br>
And his costeens are long and deep,<br>
Fast hidden from his eager eyes<br>
Still does the patch its secret keep.
      </p>

      <p>
It little matters what men say,<br>
Alike to praise or reprehend —<br>
Who goes by Grogan’s Patch to-day<br>
Knows that the quest is near an end.<br>
Soon Joe will take the quiet road,<br>
His tired hands will lift the latch,<br>
And he will find the mother lode<br>
	He sought so long at Grogan’s Patch.

      <p><i>From <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, March 17<sup>th</sup>, 1927.</i></p>

      <p>I am weary of the city, where the boss is lord of all,<br>
Of the clamor and the strife and ugliness,<br>
Where the thoughts of men are twisted, and the<br>
hearts of men grow small,<br>
And a steady job’s the hall-mark of success.<br>
For there’s nothing in the city save a senseless,<br>
fevered grind;<br>
Here a man must walk in terror of the sack;<br>
And the city people’s chatter is as empty as the wind.<br>
	But — there’s always something doing ‘way out back.
      </p>

      <p>
Curse upon the humming pavements: here it is that
mateship dies<br>
And the warm hearts of the bushland seem to
freeze,<br>
Aye, though only bushmen know it, still the real
Australia lies<br>
Beyond the last suburban boundaries.<br>
Soon again will I be going down the well-remembered
track<br>
That we trod, my mates and I, long, long ago,<br>
For there’s always something doing when a man’s
away out back<br>
In a land the city people do not know.
      </p>

      <p>
And the city folk are welcome to the empty, foolish
round<br>
Where the great dull god of Trade asserts his due;<br>
For there’s still, old timers know it, one more leader
to be found<br>
In the mulga-covered ridges back of Cue.<br>
There is still a camp-fire burning by a lonely gnamma
hole;<br>
There are still some drovers yarning by the track;<br>
There is still a boundary-rider going on his long
patrol.<br>
Oh, there always something doing ‘way out back.
      </p>

      <p>
For the city ways are narrow, and the city ways are
hard,<br>
And the minds of men are crooked as the streets.<br>
And the town-bred people ever seem to stand upon
their guard,<br>
As suspicious as the Johns upon their beats.<br>
And the grimy ways they travel, and the gods to
whom they pray,<br>
Couldn’t satisfy a man of go and push,<br>
Who has known the wider spaces, who has trod the
open way;<br>
	For there’s always something doing in the bush.

As distant hills with green;<br>
This generation can’t behold<br>
The things that you have seen.<br>
And maybe we should ponder o’er<br>
The things you say; but, then,<br>
The same things have been said before,<br>

Till death were staunch and true.<br>

That mateship lived in Flanders mud<br>
And on Gallipoli.

Could lose the modern miss;<br>

And droughts were droughts, and rain was rain<br>

      <p>
Uncle, a doubt we never hint<br>
Of all the yarns you’ve strung<br>
On days that had a golden glint,<br>
On years when you were young.<br>

you’ll carry for —<br>
The words in mateship spoken, the hand-grip in

In this world of toil and trouble it’s a heavy debt

And you’re wondering what will happen when the

      <p><i>From <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, April 25<sup>th</sup>, 1928.</i></p>

      <p>Do you remember on Shrapnel Green,<br>
On that far-off bitter November day,<br>
When the snow lay thick, and the wind blew keen,<br>
And the blanketed dead in a long row lay,<br>
When your gaze went over the tideless<br>
Where rode the monitors grey and grim,<br>
The words you said when you turned to me<br>
With voice grown husky, and eyes grown dim?<br>
You watched for a moment a ’plane’s swift climb,<br>
And you said, as a great gun belched its flame:<br>
“Surely to God there will be a time<br>
	When men won’t come at this devilish game!”
      </p>

      <p>
Have you forgotten the words you spoke<br>
When the dead in their blankets lay very still,<br>
The words you said in a voice that broke,<br>
With a monitor searching for Beachy Bill,<br>
And Imbros rising across the sea,<br>
And a fast ’plane sliding across the sky —<br>
To the left a rattle of musketry,<br>
And we poor fools in a world awry,<br>
Pausing awhile in our bitter task<br>
To wonder vainly what it could mean?<br>
Have you forgotten, old mate, I ask<br>
The prayer you uttered on Shrapnel Green?
      </p>

      <p>
Did you catch a gleam from a vanished age?<br>
Did you hear an echo from other years?<br>
Did you catch a murmur of ancient rage<br>
And see sad eyes that were dim with tears?<br>
Did you see men fight for an ancient wrong<br>
As men would fight in the years to come?<br>
Did you see the galleys and hear the song<br>
Of victors homing from Ilium?<br>
What had you seen when you turned to me?<br>
Whence came the prayer that I heard you say<br>
When your gaze went over the old, old sea<br>
On that far-off bitter November day?
      </p>

      <p>
To Shrapnel Green there has come once more<br>
The quiet dreams that the great guns broke;<br>
Men have returned to the ways of yore.<br>
But one remembers the words you spoke<br>
With a monitor shelling along the right,<br>
And shrapnel bursting above Lone Pine,<br>
And the shell-torn Green ’neath its pall of white,<br>
And the blanketed dead in a long still line.<br>
I know not whither your path has led,<br>
Your name’s forgotten, but this I know:<br>
The world has need of the prayer you said<br>
	On Shrapnel Green in the long ago.

There’s a narrow road in France that I walk in memory;<br>

      <p>
And the winter we forgot, and the days of murk and mire,<br>
And that sunken road to us was a highway of desire;<br>
And again our laughter woke, and we bore a lighter load,<br>
When the feeble sunrays played on that narrow, sunken road.
      </p>

      <p>
There are highways rich in fame that adventuring kings have trod;<br>
There’s a road of pain and tears that is sacred unto God;<br>
There are roads that lure men on till at last their strength is done;<br>
There’s a nameless road in France where we marched to meet the sun.
      </p>

      <p>
There are fairer roads perhaps, there are finer roads, and yet<br>
There’s a sunken road in France that a man will ne’er forget.<br>
It was there we met the sun, it was there we dreamed of home,<br>
	On a narrow, sunken road, east of poor shell-torn Bapaume.

They’ve tried by legislation;<br>
They’ve tried intimidation;<br>
They’ve tried negotiation,<br>

There’ll be no happy ending<br>

Lies, they tell us, in producing more and spending rather less.

Year on weary year we pondered, mile on dreary mile we went,<br>

swift year<br>
The Diggers go on their last
lone trail,<br>
Since you got your issue at
Pozieres,<br>
And I collected at Passchendaele.

      <p>
And it may be near, or it may
be far,<br>
And it may be a season of
sun, or rain,<br>
When we say farewell to the
things that are,<br>
With a hope that it has not
been all in vain.
      </p>

      <p>
An it may be that everything
will be clear<br>
When we meet the Diggers
beyond the veil.<br>
And we’ll find the reason for
Pozieres.<br>
And we’ll know the purpose
	of Passchendaele.

      <a id="The_Army_Jokes"><h3>The Army Jokes.</h3></a>

      <p><i>From <cite>The Western Mail</cite>, April 26<sup>th</sup>, 1934.</i></p>

      <p>Grey cobblestones beneath our feet, a grey sky overhead;<br>
An unknown distance still to go, and packs that hang like lead.<br>
A loud voice roaring, “Keep your fours!” Soft voices, “Go to hell!”<br>
And one complaining bitterly, “When do we get a spell?”<br>
Another asking plaintively, “How many kilos more?”<br>
	And then somebody finds a joke that runs from four to four.
      </p>

      <p>
Can you recall the welcome jokes we laughed at in the days<br>
When up and down the land of France we went our many ways?<br>
The jokes that made us for a while forget our sorry plights,<br>
The jokes that used to help us through the long and toilsome nights;<br>
The hoary jokes at which we laughed again, and yet again.<br>
And though they may seem pointless now, they were not pointless then.
      </p>

      <p>
They were not always clean, those jokes, nor were they always kind,<br>
For humour in those busy days was often unrefined.<br>
But if the victim suffered much, he swiftly found it best<br>
To hide the anger that he felt and, cackle with the rest.<br>
For those who let their anger show were sorry that they spoke.<br>
There was no pity for the man who could not take a joke.
      </p>

      <p>
Life was no joke in those hard days, yet jokes would always come<br>
When everything was upside down, and everyone was glum.<br>
In most unlikely spots they grew, from most unlikely ground<br>
They sprung, not wholly free from dirt, and sent the grins around;<br>
And never shall we quite forget the jokes that came along<br>
	And helped to make things bearable when everything went wrong.

‘E was goin’ down on a leader there that carried

      <p><i>From the <cite>Listening Post</cite>, April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1936.</i></p>

      <p>(Written for our Anzac number by Oscar Walters)</p><br>

      <p>“Why bring that up,” you’ll ask, no
doubt, “in this far-distant day?”<br>
But I contend I have the right to have
the final say<br>
About the tragedy that wrecked that
splendid scheme of mine<br>
Between the Q.M’s. store and where D
	Company held the line.
      </p>

      <p>
I’ve had a lot of time to think about it,
and about,<br>
And I’m convinced that jar was cracked
before I started out;<br>
I don’t admit a lack of care, and I denied
it then,<br>
But who could justify himself before that
crowd of men?
      </p>

      <p>
What if my speech was thick and wild?<br>
What if I smelt of rum?<br>
Who wouldn’t, when that darned jar<br>
broke, attempt to salvage some?<br>
What if there were suspicous marks<br>
down my unshaven chin?<br>
What else had I to put the drop of rum<br>
I salvaged in?
      </p>

      <p>
If any of the old platoon still hold me in
disgrace,<br>
I’d like to ask what they’d have done had
they been in my place?<br>
I’d like to ask those fellows who might
still be feeling sore:<br>
Who was it, anyway, who pinched it
from the Q.M’s. store?
      </p>

      <p>
I’d like to say to those who were so ready
to condemn,<br>
That it was pretty rotten luck for me as
well as them;<br>
It was a heavy blow to meet disaster and
defeat,<br>
In what seemed a well-planned attempt
to give the lads a treat.
      </p>

      <p>
They can say what they like, but I’ll
maintain till all is done,<br>
That it was a mishap that might have
come to anyone;<br>
And I will tell them, too, that it was
with no sense of guilt,<br>
I heard the old platoon lament the night
	the rum was spilt.

      <p><i>For <cite>The Bulletin</cite>, August 4<sup>th</sup>, 1937.</i></p>

      <p>We’re at Peak Hill in ’ninety-nine when the
Boer War breaks out,<br>
And none of us has much idea of what it’s
all about.<br>
But Bill, me mate, gets full of fight and wants
to have a bit,<br>
And nags at me to go with him and have a
crack at it.<br>
But I says, “Not for mine; let those who
start it see it through.<br>
What’s poor old Krugger done to me, or what’s
	he done to you?”
      </p>

      <p>
I argued with him day and night, and I was
right, I know,<br>
But when they called for volunteers he kidded
me to go.<br>
They didn’t ask a man to stay for the duration
then,<br>
And in a year or little more we’re both at
home again;<br>
From which time on one thing there was on
which we could agree:<br>
That soldiering was not the game it was
cracked up to be.
      </p>

      <p>
We’re out from Cue when word arrives a
bigger war’s a cert.,<br>
And I says, “Well, here’s one who isn’t going
to get hurt.”<br>
But Bill, me mate, is not so sure; he reckons
that it might<br>
Be pretty hard for any man to keep out of
this fight.<br>
And Bill was right; the sapper’s job gave both
of us a chance,<br>
And ’tisn’t long before they’ve got us digging
holes in France.
      </p>

      <p>
We put a lot of France in bags before the
game was through,<br>
And it’s a darned long time before we’re back
again in Cue.<br>
But Bill and me are both agreed, and like to
have it known,<br>
That those who start another war can have
it on their own.<br>
So if you hear us arguing when you’re around
the flat,<br>
Then you can bet your bottom bob it isn’t
upon that.
      </p>

      <p>
There’s lots of time for argument now things
are pretty slack,<br>
And old Bill goes it hot and strong, and he
gets plenty back.<br>
You’d sometimes think, to hear him talk, that
his best days are gone,<br>
But there’s one thing we cannot raise an
argument upon.<br>
That war is just a game for mugs we solemnly
agree.<br>
And then I sneak a look at Bill – to find him
	watching me.

      <a id="Carpenter_of_Nazareth"><h3>The Carpenter of Nazareth.</h3></a>

      <p><i>From the <cite>Westralian Worker</cite>, December 16<sup>th</sup>, 1938.</i></p>

      <p>When men bow down to hate and greed, and say, “Thy will be done”;<br>
When might usurps the place of right, my thoughts return to One:<br>
A simple Carpenter who came from far-off Nazareth<br>
	To bring new life into the world — the world that gave Him death.
      </p>

      <p>
When lies are fitted out with wings, while truth must slowly plod;<br>
When profiteers their voices raise in thanks unto their god;<br>
I think of One who found for us the secret and the key<br>
Among the lowly fishermen of ancient Galilee.
      </p>

      <p>
He did not dwell with those who had rich stores of corn and oil;<br>
He knew the grim companionship of hunger and of toil;<br>
He scorned the senseless arrogance of empty wealth and race,<br>
And strove to build a world where greed would find no resting place.
      </p>

      <p>
He won the hatred of the rich, and those, to their dismay,<br>
Whose smug self-righteousness He drew into the light of day.<br>
And so they slew this Man who mocked their mean, age-sanctioned plan<br>
By preaching up and down the land the brotherhood of man.
      </p>

      <p>
He saw the tyrant go unchecked; He saw men cringe and crawl,<br>
He preached a large humanity to those whose hearts were small.<br>
Betrayed by those He came to save, He suffered and He died,<br>
And after twenty centuries He still is crucified.
      </p>

      <p>
For we bow down to hate and greed, and still, to His distress,<br>
We hide our sins beneath a cloak of smug self-righteousness.<br>
But once in every year, at least, lip-service we give<br>
	To One who came from Nazareth to teach us how to live.

      <p><i>From <cite>The Northern Grazier and Miner</cite>, May 10<sup>th</sup>, 1941.</i></p>

      <p>I cannot fathom half the creeds that nowadays they teach,<br>
I cannot grasp the policies that wordy persons preach.<br>
Of one thing only am I sure, through all I hear and see:<br>
	The simple faith the Diggers held is good enough for me.
      </p>

      <p>
The world is upside down to-day, and nearly every one<br>
Can tell us in a million words the right thing to be done.<br>
The more they say the more I think – a simple bloke am I,<br>
The simple faith the Diggers held might well be worth a try.
      </p>

      <p>
They lived their faith, they did not try with highly coloured phrase<br>
To win from those who could not think a little fleeting praise.<br>
They had no time for platitudes, they had no time for guff,<br>
The Diggers had a simple faith, and found that faith enough.
      </p>

      <p>
The simple faith the Diggers held was of each man a part.<br>
It was not made for outward show, but, rooted in the heart,<br>
It stayed with them and saw them through when all the creeds
seemed cold,<br>
The simple faith the Diggers held was one a man could hold.
      </p>

      <p>
The simple faith the Diggers held might make some people frown,<br>
But never Digger worth the name has let a cobber down.<br>
They know the worth of comradeship, and after all, it may<br>
	Be that the faith the Diggers held is what we need to-day.

      <p>They do not fight for little things,<br>
The men who meet the foe —<br>
Not tinsel crowns, and tiny kings,<br>
Nor empty pomp and show;<br>
They do not fight that Usury<br>
Shall see its wealth increase —<br>
They fight to bring to you and me<br>
	The radiance of peace.
      </p>

      <p>
There was a Man, long, long ago,<br>
Who saw the false and true,<br>
Who strove to set men’s hearts aglow<br>
And build the world anew;<br>
And there were dreams of liberty,<br>
And men grew strong and bold:<br>
Hope to the world returned when He<br>
Of His New Order told.
      </p>

      <p>
And there were stirrings in the lands,<br>
And troubled were the chiefs,<br>
And fast they brought their faithful bands<br>
To guard the old beliefs.<br>
For it’s subversive to tell men<br>
That gold is merely dross,<br>
And vested interests triumphed when<br>
They nailed Him to the Cross.
      </p>

      <p>
But no seed planted in the heart<br>
Can ever wholly die,<br>
Men still are there to play their part<br>
Against the age-old lie:
      </p>

      <p>
The lie upon the upstart’s lip —<br>
The lie that fears the light —<br>
That greed is more than fellowship,<br>
And only might is right.
      </p>

      <p>
Long, long ago they killed a Man,<br>
But He died not in vain;<br>
Where’er men fight for truth His plan<br>
Is to the fore again.<br>
From century to century<br>
It shines along the way —<br>
From Ruin Ridge to Calvary<br>
From this to that far day.
      </p>

      <p>
There is no order, new or old,<br>
There is no scheme or plan,<br>
That can endure unless we hold<br>
The faith He had in man.<br>
And that faith never shall be killed,<br>
Though evil conquer good,<br>
While men will work and fight to build<br>
The human brotherhood.
      </p>

      <p>
Long, long ago they killed a Man,<br>
But He is living yet;<br>
Long, long ago there was a plan<br>
The world will not forget;<br>
Long, long ago a faith arose<br>
With which we shall not part<br>
While the fair flower of love still grows<br>
Out of the human heart.

And gone are the resolutions good<br>
We lost in the fret and fuss,<br>
But hope will stand where it ever
stood<br>
	In the years still left to us.

      <p>
Gone are the chances to make amends<br>
For the things we left undone;<br>
Gone are the chances to win the
friends<br>
Who were waiting to be won;<br>
Gone is the promise that passed us by<br>
While we balanced hopes and
fears,<br>
But faith is a thing that will never
die —<br>
And there will be other years.
      </p>

      <p>
There shall be other years than this<br>
To carry our praise and blame;<br>
There will be years when we shall
not miss<br>
The targets at which we aim;<br>
There will be years when at last we
earn<br>
The things that we now demand;<br>
There will be years when at last we
learn<br>
That only the truth shall stand.

The years come in with a promise
gay,<br>
And the years go out again,<br>
And each one carries to far away<br>
Tales of the folly of men;<br>
But ever the passing years hold high<br>
The faith and the memory<br>
Of the men who fight, and the men
who die,<br>

To teach them how to crawl along the narrow Liberal way;<br>
They’re teaching them to worship at the shrine of £ s. d.—<br>
	And this crime they’re committing in the name of Liberty.
      </p>

      <p>
They’ll teach them that the foremost fact of life they have to face<br>
Is to restrain the “working class,” and keep it in its place,<br>
That to restore to industry the good times that have gone<br>
There must be many unemployed for it to draw upon.
      </p>

      <p>
They’ll stifle every youthful dream, each generous impulse kill,<br>
The purpose of the profiteer they’ll teach them to fulfil;<br>
They’ll hound and harry them until the youths that they betray<br>
Become as mean and paltry — if that’s possible — as they.
      </p>

      <p>
They’ll teach them that the Commonwealth’s a monster to be slain,<br>
And that all thoughts of nationhood are dangerous and vain,<br>
That justice matters not at all, that privilege is best,<br>
And that the Upper House fulfils each democratic test.
      </p>

      <p>
To make things better for themselves they’ll give the nation’s youth<br>
A high regard for dividends, and scant regard for truth.<br>
The great betrayal now is on, and so we live to see<br>
Another crime committed in the name of Liberty.

      <a id="Cobwebs"><h3>Cobwebs!</h3></a>

      <p><i>From the <cite>Westralian Worker</cite>, March 26<sup>th</sup>, 1948.</i></p>

      <p>Cobwebs were a great invention<br>
Only twelve short months ago,<br>
But the best — and worst — inten-
tion<br>
Can become a source of woe.<br>
And to-day poor Ross McLarty<br>
Knows that he’s been sold a pup,<br>
And is sorry that his party<br>
Ever put the damned things
	up.
      </p>

      <p>
While the folk whose votes they
wangled<br>
Are inquiring, “What the
heck?”<br>
Ross and Co. are badly tangled
In a cobweb bottleneck.<br>
They who promised speedy action<br>
In all matters, everywhere,<br>
Plus the utmost satisfaction,<br>
Now have cobwebs in their
hair.
      </p>

      <p>
As Ross swings his duster
bravely<br>
Watts is lost in dust and doubt,<br>
Cardell-Oliver says gravely,<br>
“We will never get them out.”<br>
Parker sneezes, good old Nosey,<br>
Ross McDonald looks forlorn,<br>
Seward picks a cobweb posy<br>
From a cobweb-festooned
Thorn.
      </p>

      <p>
Doney doesn’t feel so able,<br>
Abbott doesn’t feel so good,<br>
Peering ’neath a cobwebbed
table<br>
Where they last had sight of
Wood.<br>
So they struggle, so they bicker,<br>
As their first year o’er them
rolls,<br>
And the cobwebs grow still
thicker,<br>
Even in the pigeon-holes.
      </p>

      <p>
Cobwebs seemed a great invention<br>
When the voting went their way,<br>
But they hate the very mention<br>
Of the goddam things to-day.<br>
Busy now with mop and duster,<br>
With their work not yet begun,<br>
They can only rave and bluster,<br>
Caught in cobwebs that they
	spun.
      </p>

      <a id="When_Men_to_Men"><h3>“When Men to Men….”</h3></a>

      <p><i>From the <cite>Westralian Worker</cite>, April 30<sup>th</sup>, 1948.</i></p>

      <p>Well would it be if Labor Day
were Labor Day indeed,<br>
And fellowship was mightier than
dogma, race, or creed;<br>
If there were stronger, straighter
words and fewer bending
knees,<br>
And none to brazenly aggress, or
	cravenly appease.
      </p>

      <p>
Caught in a web of hate and greed
we see the days go by,<br>
With fearful watching for the
day when we shall meanly die.<br>
Nor is there any hope for us
while we refuse to give<br>
All that we have to learn to live
as men were meant to live.
      </p>

      <p>
We talk of solidarity, of brotherhood we speak,<br>
And all the while throughout the
world the strong oppress the
weak;<br>
We talk of justice, and of peace,
and scorn our own pretence<br>
By talking, too, of atom bombs,
and atom bomb defence.
      </p>

      <p>
Well would it be if Labor Day
were Labor Day in fact,<br>
If men in all lands, on all days,
as men to men would act.<br>
We would not be preparing now
to go to war again<br>
If all to all would freely give the
	right to live as men.
