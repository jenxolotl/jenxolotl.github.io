      <h2>A Visit to the Grave of Oscar Walters</h2>

      <p>At the very end of 2019, a few weeks before I started hearing the whispers about some kind of viral outbreak in Wuhan, I took a visit to Karrakatta Cemetery to find the grave of Oscar Walters.</p>

      <p>Stepping off the train onto the always empty platform at Karrakatta Station, I walked into the sprawling cemetery, strolling through the lush memorial gardens full of colourful flowers and little plaques in the renewed section of the cemetery.
      </p>

      <p>
	An odd weathered headstone, propped up against a tree or hidden in some shadowy corner, was the only visible of what the term ‘renewal’ means: the pretty gardens memorializing the recently cremated have been landscaped over the graves of the long dead, and walking through the immaculate lawns there is little indication of what lies beneath your feet.
      </p>

      <p>
	The Metropolitan Cemetery Board has justified this process of renewal by saying that there is simply no room left at Karrakatta for new burials otherwise, and that the grants for gravesites have long expired in the sections being redeveloped. This is all true, and it is also true that this keeps Karrakatta as a ‘living’ cemetery, if you will, but the MCB finds itself in heat in the press periodically, when some family discovers that Gran’s grave has been levelled over to build a park.
      </p>

      <p>
	To find Oscar Walters’ grave I had to keep walking beyond the renewed sections, into the old and crumbling part of the cemetery that had been earmarked for Anglicans who died over seventy years ago. It was the middle of the day, and I felt the heat of the Sun on the top of my head as I walked through row after row of graves in increasing states of disrepair.
      </p>

      <p>
	It was almost as if I was walking back in time as the manicured lawns and perfectly arranged flowers gave way, first to a benign neglect, and then to a place where I could truly feel the weight of decades of being forgotten. I had a strong sense of ‘death conquers all’, as I inched between densely crowded gravesites, walking delicately between long fallen guardrails, buried under thick piles of leaves, and crumbled headstones, the colour long washed away and letters missing, standing watch at odd angles, or fallen completely to rejoin their namesake in the anonymity of the earth.
      </p>

      <p>
	The little iron plaques with numbers on them at the foot of the graves, which were my only clue for where to find this long-neglected poet, were thoroughly rusted and mostly broken at the base, lying in awkward places under leaves and at hard to read angles.
      </p>

      <p>
	I kept counting along, looking at the worn in tears on the statues of old angels and wondering how long it had been since anyone had paid Oscar a visit. His widow, Emmie, had died at a ripe old age in 1990, and as far as I could find out he had no living relatives, so I imagined it could have been at least three decades.
      </p>

      <p>
	Finally, I found him.
      </p>

      <p>
	It was obvious that he was not getting a lot of attention in his earthly afterlife. While it was not even close to being the worst grave that I saw that day, the concrete base of the grave had cracked and sunk inwards, causing the shield headstones to lean slightly at opposing angles.
      </p>

      <p>
	The top shield commemorated his brother Charles and his mother Robina, who had died in the 1920s, while the lower shield commemorated his brother Harold, who died in 1944, and finally, Oscar himself, the last of the Walters’ brothers to die. The newspaper accounts of the time indicate that Walters was given a proper send-off befitting a lifelong Labor unionist: he was lead to his final resting place in a procession containing thousands of fellow Laborites, family, friends, and other well-wishers.
      </p>

      <p>
	But in 2019, my only companion before him was the gentle rustle of the wind through the dried leaves, and the distant sound of a few crows cawing. This man, who had once had a national following through <i>The Bulletin</i>, who had worked directly under future Prime Minister John Curtin at the <i>Westralian Worker</i>, who was fondly remembered as sweet and gentle by those who knew him, who built fortifications on the beachheads of Gallipoli and in the muddy hell of Passchendaele — whose thoughts and feelings I had come to know well through his many hundreds of published poems — lay here, silent, forever.
      </p>

      <p>
	At least he has his family with him, I thought. Time keeps marching on relentlessly, and someday it will trample us all equally underfoot — our only company the wind, and the birds, and the sandy soil itself. <i>Memento mori.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
	I stood at the foot of his grave for a good while, quietly reflecting on the man and on life itself. Only the occasional leaf scraping along the ground broke the overwhelming silence.
      </p>

      <p>
	I figured that since I had come all this way to visit him, and he probably doesn’t get visitors often, I should do something to appropriately mark the occasion. I decided to read my favourite of his poems, ‘Shrapnel Green’; his poignant appeal for peace as he reflected on his experiences at Gallipoli.
      </p>

      </fig>

      <p>
	I stood and gave my reading of Shrapnel Green, six feet from the man who had written it ninety years before. To an audience of the dead, I briefly lifted the silence, and filled the air with lines about the long row of dead at Shrapnel Green, Beachy Bill, and victors homing from Ilium, come alive once more.
      </p>

      <p>
	I finished my reading, and the total silence returned just as quickly. Having paid my respects, I allowed Oscar Walters and the other long-gone people around me to return to their peaceful, calming stillness, and I turned and began my long walk back through the cemetery to re-enter the world.
      </p>

      <p>
	On the nearly empty train back into Perth, a cute gay couple were seated across from me, giggling and looking at each other with loving eyes. I was back amongst the sounds of the living.
