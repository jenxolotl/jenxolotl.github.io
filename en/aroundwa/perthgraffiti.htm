      <h2>Graffiti of Perth</h2>

      <div class="content">
      <p>One of my favourite past-times is wandering around the city, looking for the best examples of graffiti in Perth. I used to get bystanders watching me as I would dart off from the main streets in my business clothes after work, going down alleyways and walking through abandoned lots, trying to get the perfect shot of the tags and murals I would find.
      </p>

      <p>Graffiti brings life and colour to the neglected corners of the modern world. It's free, spontaneous, and democratic: anyone with some spray paint can do it, and the only reward is reputation in the scene, and the satisfaction of seeing your work up on display for all to see. The very best pieces show skill and creativity as much as anything in the traditional art world.
      </p>

      <p>More than that, graffiti is a record of a time and place, and captures the voices of people who might not leave much else of a trace. As a historical document, graffiti is priceless - the only difference between Perth and Pompeii is 6 letters and 2000 years.
      </p>

      <p>To that end I have begun a project to document the graffiti of Perth and WA more widely as much as I can. I don't claim to be an expert or a part of the scene, just an enthusiast who wants to preserve a record of Perth's graffiti for the future.
      </p>

      <p>In the following pages you can see some of the best graffiti there is to see around Perth. I've tried to include as much information as I know, which is often not much - if anyone knows more than me about the stories behind these pieces, or better yet they see some of their own pieces featured here, I encourage them to get in <a href="../contact.htm">contact</a> with me.
      </p>

      <p>The nature of graffiti makes it basically impossible for me to trace the creators of these pieces: if anyone sees their work featured here and doesn't want it featured in this project, please contact me at the link above.
