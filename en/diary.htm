      <h2>Dust in the Rain</h2>
      <p>This is my online diary, of sorts, for observations and various thoughts.
      </p>
      <hr><div class="diaryentry">
	<h3>Leaping onto the Web</h3>
	<div class="date"><p><time datetime="2024-02-29">2024-02-29</time></p></div>
	<p>The day has come! That special day, that doesn’t come around that often — it’s Leap Day!! When the last one of these happened, I was at home, reading about how the virus was spreading into Iran, Italy, and South Korea out of control... the death toll was rising, and the world was about to change completely.
	</p>

	<p><i>Ahem! Anyway —</i></p>

	<p>For this year’s Leap Day I also have a significant change in store, though I hope it’s less ‘coughy sneezy omen of looming apocalypse’ and more ‘fun and interesting addition to the vast sea of websites out there.’
	</p>

	<p>
	  Yes, that’s right, I am back online! After spending most of February feverishly brushing up on my HTML and CSS skills, selecting photos for publication, writing more poems, essays, and other pieces, tweaking, and editing, and doing some last minute debugging, I am finally ready to release my completely new and overhauled website to the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Leap Day isn’t a day that comes around often, and so what day could possibly be better to launch my website, one that I fully intend to be using until at least the next one. With this launch I am unveiling to the public years of work that I have never published before, and I am excited to finally have a proper platform to share the things I make with the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  My site may look a bit like something from the 1990s, but I think it has a certain charm, and there is nothing more satisfying than knowing that it is all the product of my own work. It has been lovingly handcrafted to the best of my abilities; from me to you, whoever happens to be reading this, whenever it happens to be read.
	</p>

	<p>
	  There is a lot of work still to be done on the site, of course: I have a history of Noongar language research that I have been meaning to write for some time now, the Asian languages section is currently empty and will take a long time to flesh out, the CSS and presentation have a lot of room for further tweaking... but I am satisfied enough with where it is to be happy to launch it into the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It is, after all, a work in progress, like life itself, and the real point of a living and dynamic website is not reaching some kind of ideal ‘finished’ state that will never be achieved, but rather the process of trying to get there itself.
	</p>

	<p><span lang="grc">Πάντα ῤεῖ.</span> Everything flows. It has been great fun making this website, and I hope there’ll be lots more fun to come before the next Leap Day comes around. — <i>Jenxolotl</i></p>

	<h3>The Rains Have Come!</h3>
	<div class="date"><p><time datetime="2024-02-25">2024-02-25</time></p></div>
	  <p>The rains have come and pattered down<br>
	    Through the streets of my little town<br>
	    And soon will come back nature's gloss<br>
	    The pretty flowers, lichens, and moss</p>

	  <p>As I sat down by the window yesterday morning to eat my toast, a wonderful sight greeted me: the sky was grey and the air was cool, and to my amazement I looked outside and saw a little puddle of water looking back at me!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Stepping outside I then realized that I had, in fact, left a tap loose when I'd watered the kaffir lime plant yesterday but, sure enough, moments later a faint pitter patter of rain started on the roof. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for me to stand out there for a good few moments grinning like an idiot, trying to catch as many drops as I could on my skin.
	  </p>

	  <p>Then I remembered that I had to go to work, ruing that I couldn’t spend the whole day outside, but at least I got to watch the rain come and go through the day.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I’ve never lost that childlike sense of wonder on seeing the rains come. And in a country like this, who can blame me? After, sometimes, going months on end without seeing a single drop of moisture, the return of the rain feels truly magical, like a long lost secret come back to restore all that is right and good to the world.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Just as I am starting to forget that rain is even possible, it returns, and with it the world changes completely in an instant. The air becomes rich with beautiful smells, the birds change their songs and movements, it feels pleasant, and even the light itself changes as everything becomes softened with a faint shadow.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The people will soon change, too. After months of complaining that the heat has been unbearable and they can’t wait for winter, they’ll soon change their tune and start complaining about how the rain is a pain and they can’t wait for some Sun again. These are the same people who complain about trees because the leaves fall on their lawns.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I almost can’t blame them — almost — for being so short-sighted, when society funnels people into working longer and harder for less pay, to the point that basic elements of life itself — the rain, trees, community — become seen as nuisances on the way to generating more profit for the ones in charge. But being trapped in a system doesn’t mean you need to support it. Indeed, there’s something wonderfully subversive about consciously taking a moment to appreciate the things that <i>don’t</i> obviously generate some kind of financial gain, whether those things be a rainy day, or a beautiful sunset, or even a cup of coffee with a good friend (and isn’t a rainy day a good day for it!).
	  <p>

	  <p>
	    To take a moment to appreciate the rain, is to defiantly insist on being human, against the overwhelming pressure to be a productive machine. To be bathed in it, enveloped by it, to become thoroughly soaked with it, is pure animal joy. The triumph of warm blood and goosebumped skin over cold logic, and the clock that never stops ticking.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    A returning customer absolutely made my day at work. I’d had a short talk with him a few weeks ago about the product that my company sells, and done the usual walk around, taking him through the showroom and discussing what our product does, how it can meet his requirements, and so on.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    It was a normal enough conversation, and I hadn’t thought too much about it until he came back recently with a big smile on his face. We talked about some work-related things, and of course since I recognized him I asked him how he was going and other stuff.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Still beaming, he told me that he’d been thinking of a change in careers: he had been working up north in FIFO for some time, but taking so many plane trips was starting to grind him down, and he was looking to do something different here in Perth.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Looking me in the eyes, he said that coming in a few weeks ago and seeing my smile, and feeling the positive energy that I gave off, had made a strong impression on him, and seeing my radiance was one of the things that really inspired him to go ahead and make a real change to his life: he wanted to start enjoying life more.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I was absolutely chuffed by this: my job has a strong customer service element, and I feel that one of the reasons I thrive in jobs like mine is because my customer service work is underpinned by genuine empathy — a real desire to help other people with whatever it is they’ve come to me for. As he said, it felt powerful because he could tell it was genuine, and it is: my work personality is really not so different from how I am in my private life.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Hearing that my warmth and positivity was coming through in my role, to the point of inspiring others to live life more fully for themselves, is absolutely music to my ears. All I have ever wanted is to make the lives of others a little easier and a little more pleasant. I was beaming ear to ear myself when I thanked him, told him what a meaningful compliment that was to me, and wished him all the best in his life.
	  </p>

	  <p>—</p>

	  <p>
	    I get comments like this about my ‘aura’ once in a blue moon, and I suppose people pick up on my love of life, and my awareness; I remember being the darling of some lovely photographers a few years ago when I was doing a shoot for PrideWA's annual Pridefest event.
	  </p>
	  

	   <p> <q>Look at those eyes!</q></p>

	  <p><q>Wow, we have to use that!</q></p>

	  <p> 
	    The photographers adored my confidence, as I allowed myself to be fully absorbed by the silky sounds of the Pet Shop Boys and their prompts, becoming something more than just myself in the process of making a good photo, all while my eyes kept telling the truth of my own story — this is a shoot for Pride, and I am proud.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    If people take something from my energy, I hope that it’s there’s nothing special about me — it’s within you, too, and you’ll find it if you look.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The rain was gently falling outside while I was writing this, and now there is the peaceful lull right after it stops. A lone bird chirping, a damp patch on the road. A young tree swaying slowly in the breeze.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Earlier today I went outside and enjoyed it, looking up at the sky and allowing my glasses to become speckled with tiny raindrops. Now it’s time to hop outside again, for a cup of tea in the fresh air, enjoying what is left of the afternoon.

      <h3>Gathering Clouds, Collecting Drops</h3>
      <div class="date"><p><time datetime="2024-02-20">2024-02-20</time></p></div>
	<p>It’s been a very long time since I attempted to keep an online diary like this - the last time I did it, Julia Gillard was the Prime Minister, and I was still in high school. At a time when I was still very much trapped inside of a seemingly impenetrable shell, I signed up to Blogger, and wrote my first post, which I think was called something like “The Light at the End of the Tunnel.”</p>

	<p>The tunnel was very dark then, and very long, but I must have caught the faintest glimmer that something could be different. My life might not actually be the life of unending loneliness and despair that I imagined for myself, back then. I could see a space for myself to exist.</p>

	<p>I wrote about the usual teenaged things, being lonely, feeling aimless, being supposedly misunderstood. I showed it to some of my classmates, and they were encouraging, and I liked it. I felt seen in a way that I hadn’t been before, and it was perhaps the first time I felt I could relate to the people around me. For their part, I had a reputation as a repressed and deathly shy loner, and I'm sure they were glad to see me open up, even a little bit.</p>

	<p>And then I stopped. My blog joined the vast graveyard of blogs that never went beyond their first post, and that was that. Life went on. And on, and on.</p>
	<p>How different everything is now! It took a while but I found that light, and now for the most part I live happily and quietly like everybody else: pursuing my hobbies and interests, spending time with my loved ones, exploring the vast world all around me.</p>

	<p>I still have worries, of course, but for the most part they are of the very material kind that everybody else has: how to keep food on the table and a roof over my head in the midst of an unprecedented rental and cost of living crisis. I see the people struggling all around me, and I feel lucky that I am in a place where my basic needs are being met.</p>

	<p>For the most part. I’m only human.</p>

	<p>As I write this, my back is getting drenched with sweat, and the prospect of rain feels remarkably distant. The clouds have come, yes, on 40+ degree days where it feels wrong for the sky to be so overcast, and the heat creates a suffocating air making Perth feel like some demented version of a tropical island, but they cruelly hold out on delivering the sweet and replenishing rain that almost makes these long dry summers worth it.</p>

	<p>When the rain comes and washes away the dust, it creates the most beautiful smell in the world. A rich, pregnant, earthy fragrance that fills the nostrils with the essence of home.</p>

	<p>The rain will come. The dust will be washed away.</p>

	<p>But for now it gathers a little longer.</p>
