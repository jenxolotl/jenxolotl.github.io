	<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

	<p>
	  The cycles of daily life repeat over and over. Every day, at the same time, the same group of old ladies walking the same little dogs, the same man at the bus stop quickly rolling and smoking a cigarette before boarding the same bus, the same greetings, the same train, the same overweight lady with the dyed hair, the same man in a hi-vis shirt with the same electric scooter, the same carriages, the same seats, the same thoughts, the same origin and the same destination.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Everybody seems to be lost in their own world, bound between the buds of their wireless headphones and the pale glow of the scrolling text and messages on their smartphone screens. Nobody seems particularly happy to be there, nor is anyone particularly sad: it just is, they just are, and the time just leeches away, until the Sun has set and the masses have retreated into their Colourbond-fenced houses, to rest, to do their chores, and to ready themselves for another day of doing it all over again.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The contrast between my weekdays and my weekends could not be more stark. In the one, the vast majority of my waking existence, the strictures and dullness of a daily job, necessary to pay my bills, and fund the adventures I have in the other, the sliver of freedom I have left to me, where no day is alike, and I routinely experience things that I have never experienced. A life where novelty itself is almost the only thread of repetition.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I often want to curse the boring conventionality of mainstream society — the seeming lack of imagination all around me — but it must be asked, how much of my observations are objective, as opposed to the subjective projection of my own feelings and life circumstances. Perhaps it is not Perth society that is feeble and stagnant, but myself. I, certainly, have a routine with about as much flexibility as one of those wind-up dolls, and I could surely be mistaken for one, sitting gazing blankly out the train window or with eyes buried deep in a book. An uncharitable person could reduce the weekends that mean so much to me to “drive to nowhere. climb mountains. eat some really shitty servo food. rinse and repeat, every week.”, and it would be unfair of me to presume the faces that I see every day do not go out on equally meaningful weekends, or have equally rich inner lives. I can’t imagine the old ladies are climbing the Stirlings every Saturday and Sunday, but surely they derive some deeper value from their dogs and their little routines.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It is probably fair to say that the vast majority of people spend the vast majority of their time doing things they don’t particularly enjoy, in the hope that their toil will eventually be redeemed in full: while the allure of heaven and its infinite reward has lost its sheen for many in this tarnished age, people still place their energy into dreams more material, but in some ways even more distant. The new car, the new house, the partner and kids and grandkids ad infinitum, the retirement that will make up for a life spent in waiting. This constant grasping for what is out of reach is everywhere, not least within myself.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I dread that, in my aspirations for a conventional life, I may end up with an existence that is nothing to envy. Since when has conventionality ever been a goal of mine? Anyone who knows me would know that ‘weird and avante-garde’ is much more my thing. I would not be satisfied with normalcy: I’d much rather ‘as weird and avante-garde as I can get away with’. The only question, I suppose, is how much I can get away with it. Australia is a place where you can get away with it a lot more than in other places — the anarchists who run around throwing up banners about the genocide in Gaza and protesting Woodside are case in point — but with the rental market fully ablaze and the job market seemingly tighter than ever, the space for self-expression in Australia is narrowing, as has been the recent trend in the rest of the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I remind myself that I have done extremely well to get to the point I’m at now: in both conventional security and personal self-realization I have come much farther than I have ever been before, and I still have plenty of room to grow further. I remind myself of what other people have accomplished in circumstances significantly more dire than mine. And I bide my time, watching the clock tick away, ready to seize the fleeting moments that happen every day, in the minutes and seconds where everything is possible.

	<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

	<p>
	  The clouds roaring over the black silhouette of the summit of Frenchman’s Peak. The road floating on a glass-top ocean on the Lake King Causeway. The Yalgorup lakes and lush green wetlands emerging from a silver sheet of torrenting rain. Long dirt roads stretching straight onto the horizon south of Newdegate. Conversations about life, death, and the moment on the top of Toolbrunup Peak. Plumes of steam rising from red metal wasteland past the disappearing edge of Oakley Dam. The water surging under the bridge in Pinjarra, the white sands and turquoise seas blending into the rocks at the mouth of the Thomas River, the wheat fields out of Wongan Hills, breakfast with the locals in Ballidu, the crystal clear sky glittering with gems at the foot of Petrudor Rock, the trucks flying past the pit stops like blinding spaceships, the seas of wild flowers out of Northam, crashing waterfalls in solitude in Marrinup. Meditating before the Stirling Ranges on Marmabup.
	</p>

	<p>
	  These are but some of the sights, and sounds, and memories, that now fill my mind after over half a year of weekends spent on the road. It is hard to find time to talk about them, when every weekend beckons me again, and again and again I find my eyes and ears immersed in scenes that transcend my description, that are beyond the many photos I have taken and poems that I have written grasping at their beauty. I feel that I have discovered some kind of fundamental truth of life, and the joy I feel when I am out there, alone, is unparalleled by anything else I have experienced in my nearly three decades in this world. I don’t know what to call what I have found, but it is there waiting for me any time I want it, whether I am in the fringes of the Wheatbelt or ringing the well-beaten track of my long familiar Point Peron.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Wherever I go, whatever I do, there is never enough time for it all, and I must pack experiences for a lifetime into the span of hours. From the view of countless places I find myself chasing the sun. I bask in its light, and cherish the way it nourishes and grows, while it also dessicates and burns. I treasure each sunset like it is a precious moment that I can never expect to come again, and I leap out of my swag at the crack of dawn, eager not to waste a sliver of the day while it still shines. I drive, I rush, I run, from place to place, driven by some kind of manic lust for life itself, the urge to do one more thing before the darkness falls.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The experience has been totally transformative for me. Many of my old fears, complexes, and traumas have evaporated in the brilliantly glowing face of my new world, and the ones that linger are meekly tempered by the power of my life. The overwhelming anxiety that once bound me like Prometheus, now recedes in the light of the fire inside. I now know what it means to be self-realized.
	</p>

	<p>
	  On the <time datetime="2025-01-18">18<sup>th</sup> of January 2025</time>, I was carjacked. Having picked up a strange and agitated hitchhiker who had been pacing up and down the Albany Highway out nowhere in particular, I found my act of kindness repaid with violence, and I was forced into a mad and extremely dangerous pursuit of the hitchhiker’s ex-partner, who had previously kicked him out of the car. I came close to death several times, and my trusty old Corolla was seriously damaged during the ordeal.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It has been a forced grounding, and it has forced me to slow down and reflect, and to take some time to prepare for getting back out on the open road. My adventures up until now have felt much like a hasty test flight, the thrill of the rush both tempered and fuelled by the feeling that everything was being held together by duct tape and pure determination, and could surely not endure the prolonged stresses forever without falling apart. Like Icarus, it felt almost inevitable that I would eventually draw too near to the Sun, and tumble helplessly to my fate.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I did not expect the end to come in the way that it did. But, unlike Icarus, I have survived, and I am just as eager now to take the time I need, to build solid foundations for a life of fun, discovery, and adventure. I want to take things slowly and make sure everything is done right — and it is only a question of when, not if, I return to the expanses of nature and the open roads of the Australian southwest. I know more than ever what I want to do with my life, and with the direction set, all I need to do is keeping walking forwards, one step at a time.

	<p>
	  Once again, it’s been an extremely long time since I’ve found the time to write one of these digital diary entries. The past few months have been the busiest, most exciting, most intense, and wholly liberating experience of my entire life. I’ve conquered many obstacles that had stood before me for years, done things I once only dreamed of doing, and journeyed, both figuratively and in a much more literal sense, to the ends of my world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  To wind back, in true epic narrative style, to the beginnings of my adventures, the long road out started somewhere in the midst of the crises and turmoil I experienced earlier this year. My astute readers would have noticed the way I wrote <q>boyfriends</q>, in the plural, in my previous entry, and I can confirm that this was neither some particularly egregious typo, nor a brief and severe medical episode, but was rather a very real and dual nightmare of a living situation that I had gotten myself into.
	</p>

	<p>
	  My life in the before times was one of chronic stagnation. I will spare my readers the long backstory — this is not an autobiography, and I can waffle on enough — but, suffice to say, I had been a socially anxious, intensely agoraphobic, hikikomori who barely left my parents’ house prior to my transition, and I had been dependent on them for everything. After I transitioned, I quite literally came out into the world, and started to find my own identity. The year <time datetime="2021">2021</time> was a wild, magnificent, and very queer time, as I lived out the very best and very worst of Perth’s little trans bubble: a bubble equally stumbled into, and of my own making. It was towards the end of 2021, with my face on posters and my pride making me feel invincible, that I met my first boyfriend.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We quickly became inseparable, feeling that we had found the perfect partner and the fairy tale romance in each other. He was younger than me, newly out himself with no relationship experience, his puppy dog eyes glowing in awe of the new confidence I had found neatly wrapped in rainbow colours. I tried to project an image of being on top of the world, and in some ways I was, but I was breaking apart inside. I had been reeling from falling out with an unrequited love I had become dependent on (remember these words), and I found myself truly alone, living by myself for the first time, in my first ever job at the age of 26, with no friends, no family, and no idea what I was doing. I was breaking down under the intense stress of it all, and found, in Boyfriend 1, an unfailing source of love and support to get me through it all.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The pride cometh before it — I had transitioned from one dependency to another.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A relationship built on sand will not last, no matter how pretty the castle appears at first. We both grew, and we grew together, and then we grew apart. The love and intimacy died at some point, and we stayed together not because of desire, but because we had become so used to each other: in my case, because of the comfort and stability that I had found with him, and, in his case, a desperate, fanatical, clinging to the ideal of a relationship, as the reality diverged further and further. The fairy tale was proven a lie, as I become embroiled in repeating emotional and physical affairs in my urges to fill the absence, while the relationship continued in zombie-form as neither of us could bear to definitively break with what was.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Polyamory was, as it is always so ideally suited to be, the compromise solution. The theory was that it would allow me to meet my emotional and sexual needs with other people, while preserving our relationship. The main issue with this theory was that by this point there was no real relationship to speak of. In practice the new arrangement was about as much a solution as a new set of cladding on Grenfell Tower; I continued to all but run off into unstable flings with anyone in sight, while Boyfriend 1 continued to defiantly stick his head in the sand.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <b>Cue the dramatic entrance of Boyfriend 2.</b> After a lengthy period of nothing much happening, I achieved a significant if somewhat embarrassingly late milestone earlier this year: my first ever full-time job. This job was absolutely life-changing for my finances and future outlook, but, in the beginning, also led to a very stressful adjustment period, as I found myself crossing over from the mass of people with lots of time and no money to those with somewhat fewer lots of money and no time. I’m sure it must come as an incredible surprise that my first resort coping mechanism was to seek out new romantic connections, and jump into bed with the first person who seemed remotely attractive.
	</p>

	<p>
	  And jump into bed I did. After meeting a trans man on one of the dating apps whom I found quite handsome, and, more to the point, quite available, I began a sexual tryst that developed faster and farther than it should have into a full-blown relationship, as I became involved in his life and, quite sensibly, decided to commit myself without reservation and take all of his many issues upon myself to fix. Including his precarious living situation, which I decided to fix by moving him in with myself and Boyfriend 1 within a month of first meeting him.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It turned out that this was not a good idea.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Boyfriend 2 was a deeply unstable, highly dependent, Molotov cocktail of a human being, thrown right into the middle of the tinder box that was my living situation. The whole affair burned everyone even tangentially involved, and nearly burned down the new life I had worked so hard to establish; it was only when I realized that it would otherwise destroy everything that I cared for, that I finally took action.
	</p>

	<p>
	  He was also something of a human Rorschach test: a negative void of personality that one could easily project their own hobbies and interests on. He had his own, of course, but it was swallowed almost completely in his issues and insecurities, and he would cling to me constantly, doing whatever I happened to be doing.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I tried to relieve the extremely toxic living situation and maintain my own sanity by taking Boyfriend 2, henceforth to be known as B2, out to do things that I had always wanted to do, but in a lingering byproduct of my earlier years, had always been too anxious to go out and do myself. In B2 I found my security blanket — an ever-willing accomplice who was always ready to go along with whatever I suggested — and this was all I needed to start living the life of action and adventure I had always wanted for myself.
	</p>

	<p>
	  With B2, and occasionally B1, in tow, I went off and climbed mountains, saw exhibits, camped in the bush, and generally started to live a more varied and interesting life. At the same time, as I survived at work and organized these adventures, I began to realize something important: it was all me. I was the driving force making things happen in my life, regardless of those around me, and I was equally as capable of making these things happen by myself as with others.
	</p>

	<p>
	  As I was having this revelation, my living situation continued to deteriorate until it became completely unbearable. B2, with his myriad deep-seated financial and psychological issues, was someone I had no future with beyond imminent destruction. I knew he was going down in flames, and unless I broke away, I would be going down with him. With no other choice remaining to me, I did something I had never done before: I initiated a break-up with someone.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It was not a dignified end: he cried, and begged on his knees to stay, and pleaded. I held firm in the face of his grovelling, however, and made it clear the end had come. Fortunately for the both of us, he accepted his fate, and was able to arrange accomodation with his family, ending the two months of unending hell that had been my home life.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I began to rebuild everything from ashes, and process how I had even allowed this to happen in the first place, while continuing my adventures, now entirely by myself. In classic post-relationship disaster cliché, I found solace and catharsis in the distant mountains and rivers where I could be alone. B1 seemed to be under the impression that, with the chaotic energy of B2 eliminated, we would settle back into our old patterns, but I had now seen the light, and I was determined to finally move past all of the old unhealthy coping mechanisms and live life, myself, on my own terms.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I had to steel myself against the puppy dog eyes that still twinkled when they looked at me, but I managed to tell him that I was breaking up with him, too, and going my own way from now on.

	<h3>Letters from a Washing Machine</h3>
	<p><time dateline="2024-07-21"><span class="date">2024-07-21</span></time></p>
	<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

	<p>
	  It’s been a long time since I wrote an entry here. Life has a way of taking the best laid of plans, ripping them out of the ground, and despatching them writhing and screaming to their undignified end.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I’m not dead, and I haven’t forgotten this place that I’ve made, but truthfully, I’ve been quite busy. I started a full-time job, one that I’ve been enjoying as far as full-time jobs go, but, as with all full-time jobs, it does not leave me much time or energy for anything else.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The implicit expectation that one’s work will and should be the defining feature of one’s life, a life that can be summarized on a form with the word ‘OCCUPATION:’ (a word that brings to mind both work and the state of most of Europe during WWII), is one that I have always rejected, and struggled against. The incredible mundanity of most jobs, and even much of the day-to-day machinations of the more interesting ones, is a dismal thing to set one’s horizons on, and I have always found it depressing how work takes even the brighest lights, and burns them out until they become as dull as all the others, reduced to the same old talk of petty office dramas, new product lines, and the kids’ swimming lessons at the pool.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Most people seem to give up sooner or later, and put all their hope into a vague idea that their children will somehow live out their dreams someday, their own dreams be damned, re-enacting in farce what their own parents did to them 30 years earlier. When the children inevitably disappoint, the hope goes into the grandchildren, and then the great-grandchildren, with the added relief that at this stage they are too old to be working, and the little ones, whatever their generation, will never grow big enough to become disappointments in their own right.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This is probably a somewhat cynical take on society, but I feel my own light beginning to flicker, and sometimes I just want to be cynical, damn it! Of course it must be said that in a purely biological sense, seeing one’s genes propagate through the generations, and living long enough to become the head of a prospering family, is the definition of unmitigated success. Being fruitful and multiplying isn’t exactly a straightforward proposition when one is queer, however (not that many young straight couples are thinking of having kids in the current rental crisis), and perhaps that is one of the reasons that I find I have to try and look outside the box to find some kind of meaning in this life.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Kids are messy, time-consuming, and expensive, but while they may not be ‘neatly packaged’ in any sense of the word, there is a low barrier to making one and they offer an arguably convenient and socially acceptable answer to the question of what one’s legacy will be; ‘what was the point of it all?’.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Without them, the question is still open, and the thought of filling the blank with work would send a shudder down most people’s spines. It is not pointed out often enough how fundamentally sick it is that people gleefully hate the place they spend most of their lives, and dread Mondays like the coming of the plague: it is not a natural state to wake up regretting the day to come, and while the lives of our ancestors were hardly easy, I highly doubt the hunter-gatherers of the past had anything close to the cynical detachment from the vast bulk of their lived experience that defines modern workers in industrialized societies.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I have tried to think of the answer myself many times, and to some extent my writings and other creative endeavours fill that desire of mine to have a legacy, for my life to have had a point, but I really suspect the question itself is, frankly, bullshit. Life is absurd and the absurdity is also not the point but when one realizes the absurdity of it all they have the ability to do something truly radical: to live, or not live, and care, or not care, entirely according to their own whims, knowing those whims have no deeper significance than the significance that one chooses to give them, and indeed they do not need more significance than that. Nothing does.
	</p>

	<p>
	  As one of my boyfriends reminded me, on one of those long winter nights where I am suffering under the weight of my own boulder, <q>We must imagine Sisyphus happy.</q>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Freedom is not something that exists in opposition to the constraints of life and society, but is emergent from it, and is only meaningful in its contrast. It grows in the cracks and pauses and minutiæ of everyday living, in the places where rules break down as a byproduct of their own enforcement. Existence enslaves and existence liberates, and it does both simultaneously. Understanding liberty and understanding slavery are facets of the same thing, appreciating existence itself.
	<p>

	<p>
	  This is all very philosophical, as it should be, and before anybody accuses me of writing an apologia for slavery (ick!), I should make it clear that literal slavery is in fact a very, very bad thing, and I use it here as a metaphor for all the things that are beyond our immediate control, and most things will always be beyond our control, no matter how hard we try to project our will onto the environments we live in. It is a kind of cosmic slavery, if you will <s>all hail Cthulhu</s>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Through understanding what is not possible (yet), we can direct our energies toward what is actually possible (now), and so maximize the limited freedom available to us.
	</p>

	<p>
	  These past few months I have often felt like I am living in a washing machine. I am tumbled around constantly in the rushing water, unable to stop, or rest, or find steady footing for my feet. It has been utterly disorienting and uncomfortable, and has come close to pushing me to my wit’s end on many occasions. I spent many days and nights ruing the collapse of my old life, and my inability to return to it.
	</p>

	<p>
	  But I have since grown used to being stuck in a perpetual rinse cycle, and now, as I learn to navigate the contours of my new environment, I find myself learning to express myself in new ways. Instead of trying to stop tumbling so that I can write, I am beginning to learn to write while I tumble. And climb mountains, and travel the south-west, and go to new places and restaurants, and see old friends and meet new people and all the other things I have been keeping busy with lately, in the spaces between my new job.
	</p>

	<p>
	  While I may not have time to write as much as I used to, or in the way I used to, I still intend to write as much as I can, and do many other things. Stay tuned for more letters from my new washing machine life.

	<p>
	  Continuing on from my previous entry, now that the Sun is shining brightly again, lighting the leaves of the little Eucalyptus tree outside my office window in brilliant shades of green, I was talking about the indeterminacy of translation between author and reader, as exemplified by the work of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha — which I highly recommend if you are interested in this sort of thing.
	</p>

	<p>
	  My choice of the term ‘indeterminacy of translation’ can’t have escaped the notice of some of my hypothetically rather eagle-eyed audience, and those familiar with it will know that it’s a seminal concept in modern linguistics and translation studies.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It was formulated by W.V. Quine, and I don’t want to get into the weeds of what he meant by it here (the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/#UndeTheoEvidIndeTran">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy’s article on Quine</a> has a good section on it for those interested); for my purposes it is sufficient to say that it broadly means that the meaning of an utterance can never be known absolutely, and the assignment of meaning to it by the one who hears it is something like a hypothesis: a best guess among many plausible guesses, which can be clarified only by further context, and questioning within the language itself — which requires knowledge of the language, and so is based on further assumptions about the entire language.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The point of all this waffling is that the very idea of <i>meaning</i> starts to break down when you really look at it. Is meaning even something real? What does it mean to mean, when you look at words on a page and see a series of squiggles, or hear them spoken, a mishmash of frequencies hitting the eardrum? There is a pattern, to be sure, if you closely study these things, but all you will find is the difference itself — a pattern of contrasts, but those contrasts are empty of any inherent meaning. This, again, is not a new idea, predating even Quine, and <q lang="fr">l’arbitraire du signe</q>, as Ferdinand de Saussure put it, is an idea which underpins modern linguistics.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The arbitrariness of the sign, the fact that it is empty of inherent meaning, is what gives language its immense expressive power. Having nothing within it, it can be filled with absolutely anything, with any thought, with any emotion, that one desires. But surely this is true of all things, since humans are beings who see faces on trees, and can read futures in tea leaves: we create meanings in everything as part of the process of being alive — even if those meanings can be pretty dubious at times.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Language, then, is not an expansion of meaning but a restriction of it: by limiting the infinite possibilities of the world around us to a small and fixed number of distinctions in sound, that we can learn together, and hold in common, and then, from this limited set, try to rebuild the entire world in replica. So, I may look at the little plush kangaroo on my desk, as I am doing now, and think it is cute, and nobody who saw me doing this would know what the kangaroo means to me, but through speaking, with others who know the words I know, I can share that it is ‘little’, ‘plush’, a ‘kangaroo’, and also very very ‘cute’.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This is not enough to give you a true image of the kangaroo, either through my eyes or my mental image of it, but, to paraphrase Cha, I can only assume you can see the kangaroo, I can only hope you see the kangaroo. I am probably the first ever person to introduce a kangaroo to Cha’s work, a ridiculously Australian contribution if there ever was one, and one bound to hop off in unexpected directions. My deepest apologies to Cha, to whom I can only say that the kangaroo is really very cute indeed.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I have here touched on the fact that I am an Australian, which I am sure will be a great surprise to my regular readers, used to me going on about WAFL games and Eucalyptus trees and so on. And some people would have thought I was from Perth! This segues nicely into the next part of my discussion, about how meaning is embedded in our widely differing places around the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The meaning of my prior section, about the kangaroo, presupposes a certain knowledge of Australia and its animals to be understandable. I don’t think too many people would be confused by the word ‘kangaroo’; thanks to the Internet, I have had the privilege of meeting people from all corners of the earth, and the first question they always ask me is something like <q>do you ride a kangaroo to work?</q> Their understandings of the ways of daily life here might be a little confused, but I can always count on them to know what a kangaroo is.
	</p>

	<p>
	  More specific things like the WAFL (West Australian Football League) or Noongar language might be more confusing, and while I try not to leave my international readers entirely in the dark, they might have to do a bit of further reading to make sense of some of my writings. On the other hand, Australian readers will recognize that my writing has a strongly Western Australian tone — ‘Australian’ might be too broad — and my fellow West Aussies will surely hear a voice that is very familiar to them.
	</p>

	<p>
	  To them, my fellow devotees of Daddy Mark, struggling against the cruel yoke of Canberra: I say don’t worry, there are plenty of other ways I can make my writing more than weird enough for you. The steady peppering of my work with references to dead White philosophers, Buddhist and Taoist masters, and contemporary avant-garde artists should be enough to put anyone off, and if it <i>does</i> all feel familiar to you <a href="./contact.htm">please get in touch</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Getting back to my point (where did that bloody kangaroo go?), this wide understanding could not always be taken for granted. There was a time, in the first fifty years or so after the British colonization of Australia, where most readers would have only had a very fuzzy image, and not in the plush way, of what a kangaroo was, and would have needed to be guided with further explanation — it is a furry animal with a head somewhat like a deer’s or a dog’s, with a pouch on its belly to carry its young, a long tail and two big feet that it hops on, &amp;c.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Kangaroos, to non-Australian people, were fantastic and incredibly exotic animals, barely imaginable by analogy to animals they were familiar with. Let’s not get started on what they thought of the platypus. In an age before images and descriptions of them were widely available, the image most English speakers had of a kangaroo, regardless of the existence of the word, was always going to be incredibly vague.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Understanding breaks down in the absence of shared context, while in the most intimate contexts language can mean much more than its conventional, general meaning. <q lang="ja">ニイタカヤマノボレ</q>, in Japanese, is a command: ‘Climb Niitakayama!’, Niitakayama, <i>New High Mountain</i>, being what the Japanese called <ruby lang="zh_Hant">玉山 <rp>(</rp><rt>Yùshān</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, the tallest mountain on Taiwan and then in the Japanese Empire. This was not a directive to mountaineers, however; on December 7<sup>th</sup>, 1941, this was the order given to the Japanese fighter pilots to begin their attack on Pearl Harbor. Code words are an excellent example of meanings understandable only to a select few; a much less ominous example is bedroom language, the language shared between lovers, but I won’t get into that either.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The effectiveness of a code like ‘Climb Niitakayama!’ is dependent on the new meaning being agreed, in conventional language, beforehand, by all the people who need to understand it. This reflects the way that language can be consciously treated as a thing in itself and modified by its users, something that I will elaborate on toward the end of this essay.
	</p>

	<p>
	  But first, you’ll have to wait. It is getting late again, so I will write my third and final part tomorrow.

	<h3>Polyphonia (I)</h3>
	<p><time datetime="2024-03-21"><span class="date">2024-03-21</span></time></p>

	<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	<p>
	  I’ve been on a pretty productive streak lately; I’ve been writing a lot of poetry and generally keeping myself occupied with the things that interest me. It feels now like I’ve well and truly found my voice, and all that remains is to continue honing and refining it, shaping it like Michelangelo’s block of marble, to best say the things that I want to say.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I can reduce this intention to a single line, but there is really beyond a lifetime of work to fall within it; I have always been learning and will continue doing so, and I am certain that I will never actually be ‘finished’ in any meaningful sense, except in the sense that I will cease breathing and that will one day be i-
	</p>

	<p>
	  The end of it all could truly come at any time, at any moment. I have no control over it, and in my financial situation the end could be pretty nasty when it comes. Perth is not a particularly pleasant place to be poor — though I’m not sure any place could claim to be. I try and live my life by the Holy Trinity of Latin sayings: <span lang="la"><i>Memento mori</i>, <i>Carpe diem</i>, <i>et Festina lente</i></span>. Remember that you will die, seize the day, and, a lesser known one that is my favourite: ‘make haste slowly’. I feel like this last one is a useful addendum to the first two: your own mortality is certainly a good reason to get a wriggle on, but it shouldn’t be a blind panic or mad scramble, but more of a cool, calculated, wriggle, doing things just the right way to worm your way into the place you want to be.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Enough of that wriggle analogy before it gets any weirder. Death is awkward enough to discuss without getting the worms involved.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I was having an interesting conversation with a friend recently, where we discussed the difference in our creative motivations: we both write, but my friend claims to write exclusively for themselves, whereas I say that I am always writing for an audience, even if this audience is a purely hypothetical one.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Lest I be accused of being a sell-out, I certainly do write for myself, in the sense that I write in a way that I like, about things that I want to write about, and my writing is surely an outlet of my creative will that I will appreciate more than anyone else.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Surely? Perhaps someone will appreciate it more than me. Zhuangzi surely knew the fish were happy.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The point, however, is that is not the end of it. Writing, as a representation of language, has a communicative function that, to me, necessitates an other, or else the entire act is meaningless. It’s the difference between speaking, even under your breath as you read this page, and a burp: one is a purely biological transmission of a noxious gas, while one is a code, an attempt to impart information onto <i>someone</i> or <i>something</i>, even when it isn’t clear what this someone or something is. A burp can also have a communicative aspect when you do it really loudly and deliberately but that’s gross and I’m not going to get into that. That thought is going in the worm bin.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I think in many ways the difference between ‘I write for myself’ and ‘I write for a hypothetical audience’ is, itself, only a matter of language. I talk to myself under my breath as I write essays like this, and nobody else will ever hear it (God I hope they don’t hear me talking to myself), but I would still say that there is an audience there, namely, me. I have vague memories of reading a study that said talking to yourself probably has some role in consolidating thoughts and processing information, and this is certainly the reason that I do it. <q>Isn’t that just writing for yourself?</q>, I hear my friend ask, and I would say that perhaps the me who reads and the me who writes are not the same me. I think Gongsun Long would appreciate the sentiment.
	</p>

	<p>
	  At any rate I feel there is some kind of Berkeleyan need to be perceived in my writing; perhaps I am such an inveterate attention seeker that, like Berkeley, I need to posit some kind of ‘universal observer’ to be an audience for my work, lest it may well as not exist.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I recently learned about a Korean-American artist called Theresa Hak Kyung Cha (1951-1982), whom I already adore, and she seems to have placed a similar level of importance on the role of audience in the creative process. In her mail poem <cite>audience distant relative</cite>, she asserts to her readers that <q>you are the audience/ you are my distant audience</q>, comparing them to <q>a distant relative</q>, <q>seen only heard only through someone else’s description</q>, and she writes:
	</p>
	
	<p>
	      neither you nor i<br>
	      are visible to each other<br>
	      i can only assume that you can hear me<br>
	      i can only hope that you hear me
	</p>

	<p>
	  In this she perfectly touches on the indeterminacy of translation between the writer and the audience, noting that neither can truly know each other, but rather, must both reach out into the ambiguous space between, the writer in sending (in Cha’s case physically mailing) out their work, and the reader in receiving and interpreting what has been sent.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This is the beautiful but uncertain intermediacy where meaning is created, not as a dictate by the creator nor some wanton assignation of the reader, but as a collaboration, where something new is made that neither side can fully predict. As Cha says in her poem, tenderly and powerfully, she can only hope that her intended message is correctly received across the divide. There is an almost spiritual faith involved in trying to communicate oneself to others.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It is quite likely that whoever reads my words will take them in a way that I did not exactly intend, for I can’t read your mind (yes, you), and you can’t read my mind. Words that mean a certain thing to me, and evoke certain thoughts and feelings, will evoke different thoughts and feelings to another, and yet this is not wrong, this is simply how communication works. The clue is in the word itself: commun + ication. It is the making common of things private, the sharing of what was previously withheld, and we hope when we communicate that we will have enough in common with whom we are speaking to, for them to understand us.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I have more thoughts on this topic, but it is getting late here, and my mind is slowing down, so I will expand on this tomorrow.

	<h3>The Summers Blend Into Each Other Like Melted Butter</h3>
	<p><time datetime="2024-03-16"><span class="date">2024-03-16</span></time></p>
	<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	<p>
	  It’s not actually summer anymore, though it certainly still feels like it, as the Sun still holds the sky unopposed, and sets each afternoon with the same brilliant golden glow. The weather has been remarkably consistent recently, hovering around 30° for the past week, and forecast to stay the same for at least a week more. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  The local Noongar people had their own seasons, viz.<br>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Birak (Dec/Jan), the bushfire period</li>
	    <li>Bunuru (Feb/Mar), the time of continued heat</li>
	    <li>Djeran (Apr/May), when the weather starts to cool</li>
	    <li>Makuru (Jun/Jul), the cold, cloudy, and wet season</li>
	    <li>Djilba (Aug/Sep), as the rains recede and it gets sunnier</li>
	    <li>Kambarang (Oct/Nov), the warm and flowery spring</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>
	  And these are much more reflective of the Southwest’s actual climate (surprise, surprise) than the old English seasons, though a friend of mine said <q>Sadly even the Noongar seasons aren’t accurate anymore</q> to me recently. It’s certainly true that the changing climate has been a part of my life as long as I have been alive, and the news reports that this summer has been the hottest and driest in history since last summer are so routine to me that I would be more amazed if the climate <i>wasn’t</i> changing.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I must’ve first noticed the seasons changing in the very early 2010s; the 2000s were a time of chronic severe drought for Australia, but I had grown up with that, so drought seemed like a normal fact of life for me. It may as well have always been like that.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The summer of 2010, however, was especially bad, as Perth recorded one of its longest ever dry spells, and was going into the end of March having not had any significant rainfall since <time datetime="2009-11-20">the 20<sup>th</sup> of November</time>. Then, after months without any relief, on the <time datetime="2010-03-22">22<sup>nd</sup> of March</time>, the storm came. A massive storm cloud came down and split the sky open in the afternoon — basically out of nowhere, I heard a thunderous sound as hail started slamming against the tin roof above my bedroom. That roof would always create a racket whenever a storm passed over, but this time it was truly deafening, and the noise continued for several minutes.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Looking out the back window, I was astounded to see a continuous stream of white hailstones falling from the sky, almost like I imagined snowfall would be like, but it was all solid ice. It was absolutely surreal and I’ve never seen anything like it before or since. It’s not unusual for Perth to get hail, but in summer, and in that volume, after so long without any rain...
	</p>

	<p>
	  The backyard and verandah were quickly becoming covered in hail as the little stones pinged off of everything in sight. It only fell for perhaps five minutes, at most, and then the storm stopped as soon as it had started: probably fortunately because our house had flooded before, and it was so intense it felt like the roof would cave in.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Instead, the cloud passed over, leaving sunshine and the sound of water dripping from the gutters, and what looked like an absolute winter wonderland to us. The backyard had been literally turned white with all the hailstones, like it was covered with a layer of snow, and my sister & I did not miss the chance to live out decades of childhood Christmas fantasies: we rushed out to play with it, crush the ice under our feet, build little ice ‘snowmen’, and generally marvel at the once-in-a-lifetime experience.
	</p>

	<p>
	  My fellow Perthians reading this will remember the immense damage the hailstorm caused: the worst carnage coming to the insurers, who ended up having to pay hundreds of millions of dollars, mostly for the many thousands of cars that were pockmarked with dents. Windows were also smashed, there was a landslide at Kings Park, some houses were wrecked, and UWA was famously completely flooded: but the worst of that happened in the city, and since we luckily escaped damage, it was a joyous day for my sister & I. As recently as the early ’20s, I still occasionally saw one of the storm cars out on the roads, with their characteristic dented bonnets.
	</p>

	<p>
	  That was a freak event, of course, and I don’t know when, or even if, I’ll ever see anything like it again. But it marked the start of what has impressionistically seemed liked a trend in Perth summers; I haven’t looked at any data, but since then it has certainly <i>felt</i> like the summers are longer, hotter, and drier, while the rain, when it comes, comes in big storms. It can be dry without a cloud for months, and then the clouds gather and everything becomes almost unbearably humid for a while, and, if we are lucky, we then get a little rain.
	<p>

	<p>
	  I often say that Perth feels tropical right before the rains come in.
	</p>

	<p>
	  All that being said, we are still in the middle of Bunuru, and so perhaps it is continuity rather than change that still prevails here. Bunuru is the ‘second summer’, as the intensity winds down, occasionally teasing at a real cool spell, but just as you become convinced you’re going to get a break, it lingers, and lingers, and lingers. The Perth summer likes to grab hold of you by the arms, and not let go until you’ve abandoned all hope of ever seeing rain again.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Then the winter comes and is gone in a flash, and the cycle repeats.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I read about an interesting concept recently, in <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2010/02/extinct-animals-are-quickly-forgotten-the-baiji-and-shifting-baselines/">an article</a>, also from 2010 funnily enough, that discusses the ‘shifting baseline theory’, in relation to the ecological tragedy that has unfolded in the Yangtze River in recent decades. A few years ago, the mighty and utterly unique Chinese paddlefish was officially declared extinct by the IUCN, having last been seen in 2003, and an official declaration on the famous baiji, last seen in 2004 or perhaps 2007, if a blurry video captured by a local fisherman can be believed, will no doubt be made too at some point in the coming years.
	</p>

	<p>
	  According to the article, a study was done on the Yangtze in 2008, led by Dr. Samuel Turvey, to determine how much the local people knew about the then very recently disappeared baiji and Chinese paddlefish. The majority of the people, as expected, knew about both the baiji (89.7% awareness) and the paddlefish (66.2%), but disturbingly the common factor among those unaware was overwhelmingly youth. Of those who had begun fishing on the Yangtze after 1996, over seventy percent had never heard of the paddlefish, and twenty-three percent did not even know about the baiji.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This idea lends credence to the theory of the shifting baseline — that the baseline will continually progress with ecological collapse, such that degraded environments become seen as normal by those who grew up with them, and even highly charismatic and culturally significant megafauna like the baiji may end up being forgotten. The result is a sad state of affairs, where people may not even be upset, because they don’t realize what they’ve lost.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I see this dynamic of forgetting at-play often in my native Western Australia. Perth has long had a largely transient population, made up of people who have rarely lived here for longer than a few generations, and with an attitude that often sees Perth as a mere stopping-point on life’s adventures: for the young, it is a place to make money before moving onto bigger and better things, while for the old, it is a place to retire after a life spent elsewhere.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The result is a place that often seems to have astoundingly little interest in where it is going or where it has been, as if it simply exists, timeless, while the world continues to turn elsewhere. Many Perthians, indeed, would see the current sad state of the south-west, with its fragmented and diminished forests and street after street of heat sink houses in the suburban area as simply being the normal state of affairs. It’s as if the Wheatbelt were always a barren landscape devoid of trees, and more than a few people wouldn’t know that the reason their home’s drainage is so bad is because it was built on the ghost of a filled-in swamp.
	</p>

	<p>
	  How many, I wonder, know that the quokka was once abundant on the mainland, before the cats, foxes, and axes drove them to almost exclusive refuge on Rottnest and other islands? Would the endangered tuart trees, or the magnificent flocks of Carnaby’s cockatoos, be remembered long if they became gone?
	</p>

	<p>
	  As the situation is, it is already difficult enough to even make the public even of the plight of a bird like the kyloring, at Cape Arid — people will not be outraged by its disappearance when they never knew it existed in the first place.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The end result of this ignorance would be something like the situation in Britain, where people praise the denuded landscapes as pristine natural idylls, and the ancient land of endless forests, bears, and wolves is, at best, a remote and mythical fairy tale.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It occurs to me that a core reason for these shifting baselines is that our current way of living — thoroughly industrialized, mechanized, and capitalized — has not only disrupted our ecosystems and the health of our planet, but is has also broken the chain of community and transmission of cultural knowledge.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Once upon a time, it would have been the elders, the grandparents and community leaders, who would pass their memories of what they had seen and what their own elders had taught them down to the future generations. This knowledge was not simply a record of things past, but was organically incorporated in a culture that perpetuated itself, and ensured its descendants would have the ability to maintain the environment they had inherited.
	</p>

	<p>
	  So the farmers would know how to farm, the fishers would know how to fish, the hunters would know how to hunt, and so on. As is well known, community knowledge could stretch back an incredibly long time. The Noongar preserved a story of a great shaking and fire upon the earth, which caused massive devastation, and led to Perth’s islands becoming separated from the mainland.
	</p>

	<p>
	  To some extent, this could very well be an authentic recollection of when the islands did separate from the mainland, over 10,000 years ago. Why, then, are the baiji and paddlefish being forgotten only years after their extinction?
	</p>

	<p>
	  Part of the answer, surely, is that the knowledge is simply not valued anymore. Whereas in times past it was essential to learn from the elders to know how to live, now, people are not seeing their futures in terms of local community, but in terms of the almost unfathomably large forces of global capital.
	</p>

	<p>
	  People don’t look to keep doing as their parents and grandparents did before them; they can see that the old ways of life are dying. Instead, they try and get ahead, trying to get a slightly higher spot on the ladder than all the the people who are sliding off into the dark waters of poverty and financial uncertainty, and they dream of all the things that define a successful life in a thoroughly capitalist world. In Perth and the China of 2008 alike, people dream of learning valuable skills like medicine or programming, making it big, heading off to the prestige and glory of places like New York and Paris.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Increasingly again, these are dreams that seem out of reach for most people. But the communities of old are still dead and dying. With nothing to hope for, then, people turn to drink, drugs, social media, Netflix... the escapist pleasures of a dying world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The news that yet another species has died, or that next summer will be even hotter than the last one become just too depressing to think about. It feels depressing for <i>me</i> to think about. But, I don’t think all is lost, just yet. The human spirit is still there, and people are remarkably resilient and creative in the ways they have adapted to our rapidly changing environment. I wouldn’t say I know the answer, exactly — who but a charlatan would? — but I am pretty sure that it involves living more consciously, revaluing and re-establishing local community, and ultimately rebuilding the chains of knowledge that will ensure our continued survival into the future.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The coming of modernization, and the poisonous hyper-capitalism that has come with it, has caused untold devastation to our cultures, communities, health, and ecosystems. But it has also brought us together, and made knowledge more widely available than at any point in history. The trick, there, is translating ‘available’ into ‘accessible’.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We can’t turn back the clock to the baselines that used to be. But, as Bunuru continues to march on to its much awaited end, perhaps we can be more aware of what was, and slowly, over time, start shifting the baseline back in the other direction.

	  On Saturday, after years of growing buzz around the rise of women’s footy, I finally made it out to see how the women’s league is doing in WA. An opportunity presented itself that was too good to pass up: the first game of the season, after months of being footy starved (I’ve never really seen the appeal of cricket), and it was against the ruddy Dogs no less!</p>

	<p>
	  Surely there would be no better introduction than watching <b>Reigning Premiers the East Fremantle Sharks</b> beat our arch-nemesis, I thought, and moreover it was a golden opportunity to introduce one of my good friends, who came over from China last year, to the national game.
	</p>

	<p>
	  On a lovely overcast, if a bit warm, day, I went out and met up with my friend and my boyfriend, and after spending some time at the Market, where I got my customary momo from Tibet Stove (I was surprised to realize I can half-read the menu now! My Dzongkha study is paying off.), we went down to hang out at South Beach for a while before coming back up just in time for the game to start at <time datetime="2024-03-02 16:40">4:40</time>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The crowd was fairly small, probably no more than 250 people, which is unfortunately less than 5% of the crowd that could be expected at a men’s Freo derby — but it was a crowd nonetheless, and as women’s footy continues to gain mainstream attention at the national level in the AFLW, surely some will trickle down to the state level women’s comp.
	</p>

	<p>
	  That being said, the small crowd gave the game an intimate community feel that is one of the things I love about WAFL footy, and I was happy to be there supporting my team against the old enemy, and supporting women’s footy in general. Despite clearly being in the early stages there is a real sense of being on the ground at the start of something big — it was heartwarming to see all the young girls at halftime enthusiastically taking up the sport.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The game itself was a low-scoring, scrappy affair that saw a lot of back and forth going on in the middle with little to show for it. Goals were hard to come by, and a goal by Souths late in the third quarter left the Sharks just a couple of points behind, setting up an incredibly tight final quarter.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The final quarter was when the game truly came into its own, with the Sharks in true East Freo fashion coming ahead with a mark and brilliant goal from about 35 out, and then nearly giving me a heart attack as the Bulldogs rushed forward repeatedly in a feverish attempt to regain the lead.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The Sharks defence was strong, however, and despite conceding a point, that goal ended up being enough to see the Sharks over the line as the whistle blew, winning in the end by 3 points, South Fremantle’s 3.7.25 to East Fremantle 4.4.28. The newly transferred Sarah Wielstra stood out to me for outstanding ruckwork which unfortunately was not capitalized on as fully as it could’ve been, and she promises to be a core player for the Sharks’ flag defence this year.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The young Zipporah ‘Zippy’ Fish, in addition to having one of the best footy names I have heard in a while, is being widely talked about as future AFLW material, and it’s not hard to see why, with how impressively she is playing at the age of only 17.
	</p>

	<p>
	  After enjoying the well-deserved victory, we headed back down to South Beach to stop at the Run Amuk for dinner. An incredibly cute little diner, it’s been on my list for ages, and the food and service certainly didn’t disappoint: the gloriously over the top hot dogs tasted as stunning as they looked, the spearmint milkshake was perfect and delightfully creamy, and we were served in such a lovely manner, all three of the staff coming out to us with our food simultaneously, that I felt like I was at a five star restaurant. To my mind, this one certainly was. ★★★★★

	<h3>Leaping onto the Web</h3>
	<p><time datetime="2024-02-29"><span class="date">2024-02-29</span></time></p>
	<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	
	<p>The day has come! That special day, that doesn’t come around that often — it’s Leap Day!! When the last one of these happened, I was at home, reading about how the virus was spreading into Iran, Italy, and South Korea out of control... the death toll was rising, and the world was about to change completely.
	</p>

	<p><i>Ahem! Anyway —</i></p>

	<p>For this year’s Leap Day I also have a significant change in store, though I hope it’s less ‘coughy sneezy omen of looming apocalypse’ and more ‘fun and interesting addition to the vast sea of websites out there.’
	</p>

	<p>
	  Yes, that’s right, I am back online! After spending most of February feverishly brushing up on my HTML and CSS skills, selecting photos for publication, writing more poems, essays, and other pieces, tweaking, and editing, and doing some last minute debugging, I am finally ready to release my completely new and overhauled website to the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Leap Day isn’t a day that comes around often, and so what day could possibly be better to launch my website, one that I fully intend to be using until at least the next one. With this launch I am unveiling to the public years of work that I have never published before, and I am excited to finally have a proper platform to share the things I make with the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  My site may look a bit like something from the 1990s, but I think it has a certain charm, and there is nothing more satisfying than knowing that it is all the product of my own work. It has been lovingly handcrafted to the best of my abilities; from me to you, whoever happens to be reading this, whenever it happens to be read.
	</p>

	<p>
	  There is a lot of work still to be done on the site, of course: I have a history of Noongar language research that I have been meaning to write for some time now, the Asian languages section is currently empty and will take a long time to flesh out, the CSS and presentation have a lot of room for further tweaking... but I am satisfied enough with where it is to be happy to launch it into the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It is, after all, a work in progress, like life itself, and the real point of a living and dynamic website is not reaching some kind of ideal ‘finished’ state that will never be achieved, but rather the process of trying to get there itself.
	</p>

	<p><span lang="grc">Πάντα ῤεῖ.</span> Everything flows. It has been great fun making this website, and I hope there’ll be lots more fun to come before the next Leap Day comes around. — <i>Jenxolotl</i></p>

	<h3>The Rains Have Come!</h3>
	<p><time datetime="2024-02-25"><span class="date">2024-02-25</span></time></p>

	<p>
	  <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>The rains have come and pattered down<br>
	    Through the streets of my little town<br>
	    And soon will come back nature’s gloss<br>
	    The pretty flowers, lichens, and moss</p>

	  <p>As I sat down by the window yesterday morning to eat my toast, a wonderful sight greeted me: the sky was grey and the air was cool, and to my amazement I looked outside and saw a little puddle of water looking back at me!
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Stepping outside I then realized that I had, in fact, left a tap loose when I'd watered the kaffir lime plant yesterday but, sure enough, moments later a faint pitter patter of rain started on the roof. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for me to stand out there for a good few moments grinning like an idiot, trying to catch as many drops as I could on my skin.
	  </p>

	  <p>Then I remembered that I had to go to work, ruing that I couldn’t spend the whole day outside, but at least I got to watch the rain come and go through the day.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I’ve never lost that childlike sense of wonder on seeing the rains come. And in a country like this, who can blame me? After, sometimes, going months on end without seeing a single drop of moisture, the return of the rain feels truly magical, like a long lost secret come back to restore all that is right and good to the world.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Just as I am starting to forget that rain is even possible, it returns, and with it the world changes completely in an instant. The air becomes rich with beautiful smells, the birds change their songs and movements, it feels pleasant, and even the light itself changes as everything becomes softened with a faint shadow.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The people will soon change, too. After months of complaining that the heat has been unbearable and they can’t wait for winter, they’ll soon change their tune and start complaining about how the rain is a pain and they can’t wait for some Sun again. These are the same people who complain about trees because the leaves fall on their lawns.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I almost can’t blame them — almost — for being so short-sighted, when society funnels people into working longer and harder for less pay, to the point that basic elements of life itself — the rain, trees, community — become seen as nuisances on the way to generating more profit for the ones in charge. But being trapped in a system doesn’t mean you need to support it. Indeed, there’s something wonderfully subversive about consciously taking a moment to appreciate the things that <i>don’t</i> obviously generate some kind of financial gain, whether those things be a rainy day, or a beautiful sunset, or even a cup of coffee with a good friend (and isn’t a rainy day a good day for it!).
	  <p>

	  <p>
	    To take a moment to appreciate the rain, is to defiantly insist on being human, against the overwhelming pressure to be a productive machine. To be bathed in it, enveloped by it, to become thoroughly soaked with it, is pure animal joy. The triumph of warm blood and goosebumped skin over cold logic, and the clock that never stops ticking.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    A returning customer absolutely made my day at work. I’d had a short talk with him a few weeks ago about the product that my company sells, and done the usual walk around, taking him through the showroom and discussing what our product does, how it can meet his requirements, and so on.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    It was a normal enough conversation, and I hadn’t thought too much about it until he came back recently with a big smile on his face. We talked about some work-related things, and of course since I recognized him I asked him how he was going and other stuff.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Still beaming, he told me that he’d been thinking of a change in careers: he had been working up north in FIFO for some time, but taking so many plane trips was starting to grind him down, and he was looking to do something different here in Perth.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Looking me in the eyes, he said that coming in a few weeks ago and seeing my smile, and feeling the positive energy that I gave off, had made a strong impression on him, and seeing my radiance was one of the things that really inspired him to go ahead and make a real change to his life: he wanted to start enjoying life more.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I was absolutely chuffed by this: my job has a strong customer service element, and I feel that one of the reasons I thrive in jobs like mine is because my customer service work is underpinned by genuine empathy — a real desire to help other people with whatever it is they’ve come to me for. As he said, it felt powerful because he could tell it was genuine, and it is: my work personality is really not so different from how I am in my private life.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Hearing that my warmth and positivity was coming through in my role, to the point of inspiring others to live life more fully for themselves, is absolutely music to my ears. All I have ever wanted is to make the lives of others a little easier and a little more pleasant. I was beaming ear to ear myself when I thanked him, told him what a meaningful compliment that was to me, and wished him all the best in his life.
	  </p>

	  <p>—</p>

	  <p>
	    I get comments like this about my ‘aura’ once in a blue moon, and I suppose people pick up on my love of life, and my awareness; I remember being the darling of some lovely photographers a few years ago when I was doing a shoot for PrideWA's annual Pridefest event.
	  </p>
	  

	   <p> <q>Look at those eyes!</q></p>

	  <p><q>Wow, we have to use that!</q></p>

	  <p> 
	    The photographers adored my confidence, as I allowed myself to be fully absorbed by the silky sounds of the Pet Shop Boys and their prompts, becoming something more than just myself in the process of making a good photo, all while my eyes kept telling the truth of my own story — this is a shoot for Pride, and I am proud.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    If people take something from my energy, I hope that it’s there’s nothing special about me — it’s within you, too, and you’ll find it if you look.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The rain was gently falling outside while I was writing this, and now there is the peaceful lull right after it stops. A lone bird chirping, a damp patch on the road. A young tree swaying slowly in the breeze.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Earlier today I went outside and enjoyed it, looking up at the sky and allowing my glasses to become speckled with tiny raindrops. Now it’s time to hop outside again, for a cup of tea in the fresh air, enjoying what is left of the afternoon.

      <h3>Gathering Clouds, Collecting Drops</h3>
      <p><time datetime="2024-02-20"><span class="date">2024-02-20</span></time></p>

	<p>It’s been a very long time since I attempted to keep an online diary like this - the last time I did it, Julia Gillard was the Prime Minister, and I was still in high school. At a time when I was still very much trapped inside of a seemingly impenetrable shell, I signed up to Blogger, and wrote my first post, which I think was called something like “The Light at the End of the Tunnel.”</p>

	<p>The tunnel was very dark then, and very long, but I must have caught the faintest glimmer that something could be different. My life might not actually be the life of unending loneliness and despair that I imagined for myself, back then. I could see a space for myself to exist.</p>

	<p>I wrote about the usual teenaged things, being lonely, feeling aimless, being supposedly misunderstood. I showed it to some of my classmates, and they were encouraging, and I liked it. I felt seen in a way that I hadn’t been before, and it was perhaps the first time I felt I could relate to the people around me. For their part, I had a reputation as a repressed and deathly shy loner, and I'm sure they were glad to see me open up, even a little bit.</p>

	<p>And then I stopped. My blog joined the vast graveyard of blogs that never went beyond their first post, and that was that. Life went on. And on, and on.</p>
	<p>How different everything is now! It took a while but I found that light, and now for the most part I live happily and quietly like everybody else: pursuing my hobbies and interests, spending time with my loved ones, exploring the vast world all around me.</p>

	<p>I still have worries, of course, but for the most part they are of the very material kind that everybody else has: how to keep food on the table and a roof over my head in the midst of an unprecedented rental and cost of living crisis. I see the people struggling all around me, and I feel lucky that I am in a place where my basic needs are being met.</p>

	<p>For the most part. I’m only human.</p>

	<p>As I write this, my back is getting drenched with sweat, and the prospect of rain feels remarkably distant. The clouds have come, yes, on 40+ degree days where it feels wrong for the sky to be so overcast, and the heat creates a suffocating air making Perth feel like some demented version of a tropical island, but they cruelly hold out on delivering the sweet and replenishing rain that almost makes these long dry summers worth it.</p>

	<p>When the rain comes and washes away the dust, it creates the most beautiful smell in the world. A rich, pregnant, earthy fragrance that fills the nostrils with the essence of home.</p>

	<p>The rain will come. The dust will be washed away.</p>

	<p>But for now it gathers a little longer.</p>
