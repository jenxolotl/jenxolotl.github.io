	<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	<p>
	  I’ve been on a pretty productive streak lately; I’ve been writing a lot of poetry and generally keeping myself occupied with the things that interest me. It feels now like I’ve well and truly found my voice, and all that remains is to continue honing and refining it, shaping it like Michelangelo’s block of marble, to best say the things that I want to say.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I can reduce this intention to a single line, but there is really beyond a lifetime of work to fall within it; I have always been learning and will continue doing so, and I am certain that I will never actually be ‘finished’ in any meaningful sense, except in the sense that I will cease breathing and that will one day be i-
	</p>

	<p>
	  The end of it all could truly come at any time, at any moment. I have no control over it, and in my financial situation the end could be pretty nasty when it comes. Perth is not a particularly pleasant place to be poor — though I’m not sure any place could claim to be. I try and live my life by the Holy Trinity of Latin sayings: <span lang="la"><i>Memento mori</i>, <i>Carpe diem</i>, <i>et Festina lente</i></span>. Remember that you will die, seize the day, and, a lesser known one that is my favourite: ‘make haste slowly’. I feel like this last one is a useful addendum to the first two: your own mortality is certainly a good reason to get a wriggle on, but it shouldn’t be a blind panic or mad scramble, but more of a cool, calculated, wriggle, doing things just the right way to worm your way into the place you want to be.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Enough of that wriggle analogy before it gets any weirder. Death is awkward enough to discuss without getting the worms involved.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I was having an interesting conversation with a friend recently, where we discussed the difference in our creative motivations: we both write, but my friend claims to write exclusively for themselves, whereas I say that I am always writing for an audience, even if this audience is a purely hypothetical one.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Lest I be accused of being a sell-out, I certainly do write for myself, in the sense that I write in a way that I like, about things that I want to write about, and my writing is surely an outlet of my creative will that I will appreciate more than anyone else.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Surely? Perhaps someone will appreciate it more than me. Zhuangzi surely knew the fish were happy.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The point, however, is that is not the end of it. Writing, as a representation of language, has a communicative function that, to me, necessitates an other, or else the entire act is meaningless. It’s the difference between speaking, even under your breath as you read this page, and a burp: one is a purely biological transmission of a noxious gas, while one is a code, an attempt to impart information onto <i>someone</i> or <i>something</i>, even when it isn’t clear what this someone or something is. A burp can also have a communicative aspect when you do it really loudly and deliberately but that’s gross and I’m not going to get into that. That thought is going in the worm bin.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I think in many ways the difference between ‘I write for myself’ and ‘I write for a hypothetical audience’ is, itself, only a matter of language. I talk to myself under my breath as I write essays like this, and nobody else will ever hear it (God I hope they don’t hear me talking to myself), but I would still say that there is an audience there, namely, me. I have vague memories of reading a study that said talking to yourself probably has some role in consolidating thoughts and processing information, and this is certainly the reason that I do it. <q>Isn’t that just writing for yourself?</q>, I hear my friend ask, and I would say that perhaps the me who reads and the me who writes are not the same me. I think Gongsun Long would appreciate the sentiment.
	</p>

	<p>
	  At any rate I feel there is some kind of Berkeleyan need to be perceived in my writing; perhaps I am such an inveterate attention seeker that, like Berkeley, I need to posit some kind of ‘universal observer’ to be an audience for my work, lest it may well as not exist.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I recently learned about a Korean-American artist called Theresa Hak Kyung Cha (1951-1982), whom I already adore, and she seems to have placed a similar level of importance on the role of audience in the creative process. In her mail poem <cite>audience distant relative</cite>, she asserts to her readers that <q>you are the audience/ you are my distant audience</q>, comparing them to <q>a distant relative</q>, <q>seen only heard only through someone else’s description</q>, and she writes:
	</p>
	
	<p>
	      neither you nor i<br>
	      are visible to each other<br>
	      i can only assume that you can hear me<br>
	      i can only hope that you hear me
	</p>

	<p>
	  In this she perfectly touches on the indeterminacy of translation between the writer and the audience, noting that neither can truly know each other, but rather, must both reach out into the ambiguous space between, the writer in sending (in Cha’s case physically mailing) out their work, and the reader in receiving and interpreting what has been sent.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This is the beautiful but uncertain intermediacy where meaning is created, not as a dictate by the creator nor some wanton assignation of the reader, but as a collaboration, where something new is made that neither side can fully predict. As Cha says in her poem, tenderly and powerfully, she can only hope that her intended message is correctly received across the divide. There is an almost spiritual faith involved in trying to communicate oneself to others.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It is quite likely that whoever reads my words will take them in a way that I did not exactly intend, for I can’t read your mind (yes, you), and you can’t read my mind. Words that mean a certain thing to me, and evoke certain thoughts and feelings, will evoke different thoughts and feelings to another, and yet this is not wrong, this is simply how communication works. The clue is in the word itself: commun + ication. It is the making common of things private, the sharing of what was previously withheld, and we hope when we communicate that we will have enough in common with whom we are speaking to, for them to understand us.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I have more thoughts on this topic, but it is getting late here, and my mind is slowing down, so I will expand on this tomorrow.

	<h3>The Summers Blend Into Each Other Like Melted Butter</h3>
	<p><time datetime="2024-03-16"><span class="date">2024-03-16</span></time></p>
	<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	<p>
	  It’s not actually summer anymore, though it certainly still feels like it, as the Sun still holds the sky unopposed, and sets each afternoon with the same brilliant golden glow. The weather has been remarkably consistent recently, hovering around 30° for the past week, and forecast to stay the same for at least a week more. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  The local Noongar people had their own seasons, viz.<br>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Birak (Dec/Jan), the bushfire period</li>
	    <li>Bunuru (Feb/Mar), the time of continued heat</li>
	    <li>Djeran (Apr/May), when the weather starts to cool</li>
	    <li>Makuru (Jun/Jul), the cold, cloudy, and wet season</li>
	    <li>Djilba (Aug/Sep), as the rains recede and it gets sunnier</li>
	    <li>Kambarang (Oct/Nov), the warm and flowery spring</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>
	  And these are much more reflective of the Southwest’s actual climate (surprise, surprise) than the old English seasons, though a friend of mine said <q>Sadly even the Noongar seasons aren’t accurate anymore</q> to me recently. It’s certainly true that the changing climate has been a part of my life as long as I have been alive, and the news reports that this summer has been the hottest and driest in history since last summer are so routine to me that I would be more amazed if the climate <i>wasn’t</i> changing.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I must’ve first noticed the seasons changing in the very early 2010s; the 2000s were a time of chronic severe drought for Australia, but I had grown up with that, so drought seemed like a normal fact of life for me. It may as well have always been like that.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The summer of 2010, however, was especially bad, as Perth recorded one of its longest ever dry spells, and was going into the end of March having not had any significant rainfall since <time datetime="2009-11-20">the 20<sup>th</sup> of November</time>. Then, after months without any relief, on the <time datetime="2010-03-22">22<sup>nd</sup> of March</time>, the storm came. A massive storm cloud came down and split the sky open in the afternoon — basically out of nowhere, I heard a thunderous sound as hail started slamming against the tin roof above my bedroom. That roof would always create a racket whenever a storm passed over, but this time it was truly deafening, and the noise continued for several minutes.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Looking out the back window, I was astounded to see a continuous stream of white hailstones falling from the sky, almost like I imagined snowfall would be like, but it was all solid ice. It was absolutely surreal and I’ve never seen anything like it before or since. It’s not unusual for Perth to get hail, but in summer, and in that volume, after so long without any rain...
	</p>

	<p>
	  The backyard and verandah were quickly becoming covered in hail as the little stones pinged off of everything in sight. It only fell for perhaps five minutes, at most, and then the storm stopped as soon as it had started: probably fortunately because our house had flooded before, and it was so intense it felt like the roof would cave in.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Instead, the cloud passed over, leaving sunshine and the sound of water dripping from the gutters, and what looked like an absolute winter wonderland to us. The backyard had been literally turned white with all the hailstones, like it was covered with a layer of snow, and my sister & I did not miss the chance to live out decades of childhood Christmas fantasies: we rushed out to play with it, crush the ice under our feet, build little ice ‘snowmen’, and generally marvel at the once-in-a-lifetime experience.
	</p>

	<p>
	  My fellow Perthians reading this will remember the immense damage the hailstorm caused: the worst carnage coming to the insurers, who ended up having to pay hundreds of millions of dollars, mostly for the many thousands of cars that were pockmarked with dents. Windows were also smashed, there was a landslide at Kings Park, some houses were wrecked, and UWA was famously completely flooded: but the worst of that happened in the city, and since we luckily escaped damage, it was a joyous day for my sister & I. As recently as the early ’20s, I still occasionally saw one of the storm cars out on the roads, with their characteristic dented bonnets.
	</p>

	<p>
	  That was a freak event, of course, and I don’t know when, or even if, I’ll ever see anything like it again. But it marked the start of what has impressionistically seemed liked a trend in Perth summers; I haven’t looked at any data, but since then it has certainly <i>felt</i> like the summers are longer, hotter, and drier, while the rain, when it comes, comes in big storms. It can be dry without a cloud for months, and then the clouds gather and everything becomes almost unbearably humid for a while, and, if we are lucky, we then get a little rain.
	<p>

	<p>
	  I often say that Perth feels tropical right before the rains come in.
	</p>

	<p>
	  All that being said, we are still in the middle of Bunuru, and so perhaps it is continuity rather than change that still prevails here. Bunuru is the ‘second summer’, as the intensity winds down, occasionally teasing at a real cool spell, but just as you become convinced you’re going to get a break, it lingers, and lingers, and lingers. The Perth summer likes to grab hold of you by the arms, and not let go until you’ve abandoned all hope of ever seeing rain again.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Then the winter comes and is gone in a flash, and the cycle repeats.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I read about an interesting concept recently, in <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2010/02/extinct-animals-are-quickly-forgotten-the-baiji-and-shifting-baselines/">an article</a>, also from 2010 funnily enough, that discusses the ‘shifting baseline theory’, in relation to the ecological tragedy that has unfolded in the Yangtze River in recent decades. A few years ago, the mighty and utterly unique Chinese paddlefish was officially declared extinct by the IUCN, having last been seen in 2003, and an official declaration on the famous baiji, last seen in 2004 or perhaps 2007, if a blurry video captured by a local fisherman can be believed, will no doubt be made too at some point in the coming years.
	</p>

	<p>
	  According to the article, a study was done on the Yangtze in 2008, led by Dr. Samuel Turvey, to determine how much the local people knew about the then very recently disappeared baiji and Chinese paddlefish. The majority of the people, as expected, knew about both the baiji (89.7% awareness) and the paddlefish (66.2%), but disturbingly the common factor among those unaware was overwhelmingly youth. Of those who had begun fishing on the Yangtze after 1996, over seventy percent had never heard of the paddlefish, and twenty-three percent did not even know about the baiji.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This idea lends credence to the theory of the shifting baseline — that the baseline will continually progress with ecological collapse, such that degraded environments become seen as normal by those who grew up with them, and even highly charismatic and culturally significant megafauna like the baiji may end up being forgotten. The result is a sad state of affairs, where people may not even be upset, because they don’t realize what they’ve lost.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I see this dynamic of forgetting at-play often in my native Western Australia. Perth has long had a largely transient population, made up of people who have rarely lived here for longer than a few generations, and with an attitude that often sees Perth as a mere stopping-point on life’s adventures: for the young, it is a place to make money before moving onto bigger and better things, while for the old, it is a place to retire after a life spent elsewhere.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The result is a place that often seems to have astoundingly little interest in where it is going or where it has been, as if it simply exists, timeless, while the world continues to turn elsewhere. Many Perthians, indeed, would see the current sad state of the south-west, with its fragmented and diminished forests and street after street of heat sink houses in the suburban area as simply being the normal state of affairs. It’s as if the Wheatbelt were always a barren landscape devoid of trees, and more than a few people wouldn’t know that the reason their home’s drainage is so bad is because it was built on the ghost of a filled-in swamp.
	</p>

	<p>
	  How many, I wonder, know that the quokka was once abundant on the mainland, before the cats, foxes, and axes drove them to almost exclusive refuge on Rottnest and other islands? Would the endangered tuart trees, or the magnificent flocks of Carnaby’s cockatoos, be remembered long if they became gone?
	</p>

	<p>
	  As the situation is, it is already difficult enough to even make the public even of the plight of a bird like the kyloring, at Cape Arid — people will not be outraged by its disappearance when they never knew it existed in the first place.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The end result of this ignorance would be something like the situation in Britain, where people praise the denuded landscapes as pristine natural idylls, and the ancient land of endless forests, bears, and wolves is, at best, a remote and mythical fairy tale.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It occurs to me that a core reason for these shifting baselines is that our current way of living — thoroughly industrialized, mechanized, and capitalized — has not only disrupted our ecosystems and the health of our planet, but is has also broken the chain of community and transmission of cultural knowledge.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Once upon a time, it would have been the elders, the grandparents and community leaders, who would pass their memories of what they had seen and what their own elders had taught them down to the future generations. This knowledge was not simply a record of things past, but was organically incorporated in a culture that perpetuated itself, and ensured its descendants would have the ability to maintain the environment they had inherited.
	</p>

	<p>
	  So the farmers would know how to farm, the fishers would know how to fish, the hunters would know how to hunt, and so on. As is well known, community knowledge could stretch back an incredibly long time. The Noongar preserved a story of a great shaking and fire upon the earth, which caused massive devastation, and led to Perth’s islands becoming separated from the mainland.
	</p>

	<p>
	  To some extent, this could very well be an authentic recollection of when the islands did separate from the mainland, over 10,000 years ago. Why, then, are the baiji and paddlefish being forgotten only years after their extinction?
	</p>

	<p>
	  Part of the answer, surely, is that the knowledge is simply not valued anymore. Whereas in times past it was essential to learn from the elders to know how to live, now, people are not seeing their futures in terms of local community, but in terms of the almost unfathomably large forces of global capital.
	</p>

	<p>
	  People don’t look to keep doing as their parents and grandparents did before them; they can see that the old ways of life are dying. Instead, they try and get ahead, trying to get a slightly higher spot on the ladder than all the the people who are sliding off into the dark waters of poverty and financial uncertainty, and they dream of all the things that define a successful life in a thoroughly capitalist world. In Perth and the China of 2008 alike, people dream of learning valuable skills like medicine or programming, making it big, heading off to the prestige and glory of places like New York and Paris.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Increasingly again, these are dreams that seem out of reach for most people. But the communities of old are still dead and dying. With nothing to hope for, then, people turn to drink, drugs, social media, Netflix... the escapist pleasures of a dying world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The news that yet another species has died, or that next summer will be even hotter than the last one become just too depressing to think about. It feels depressing for <i>me</i> to think about. But, I don’t think all is lost, just yet. The human spirit is still there, and people are remarkably resilient and creative in the ways they have adapted to our rapidly changing environment. I wouldn’t say I know the answer, exactly — who but a charlatan would? — but I am pretty sure that it involves living more consciously, revaluing and re-establishing local community, and ultimately rebuilding the chains of knowledge that will ensure our continued survival into the future.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The coming of modernization, and the poisonous hyper-capitalism that has come with it, has caused untold devastation to our cultures, communities, health, and ecosystems. But it has also brought us together, and made knowledge more widely available than at any point in history. The trick, there, is translating ‘available’ into ‘accessible’.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We can’t turn back the clock to the baselines that used to be. But, as Bunuru continues to march on to its much awaited end, perhaps we can be more aware of what was, and slowly, over time, start shifting the baseline back in the other direction.

	<h3>The Women’s Freo Derby</h3>
	<p><time datetime="2024-03-04"><span class="date">2024-03-04</span></time></p>
	<p>
	  <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	</p>


	<p>
	  On Saturday, after years of growing buzz around the rise of women’s footy, I finally made it out to see how the women’s league is doing in WA. An opportunity presented itself that was too good to pass up: the first game of the season, after months of being footy starved (I’ve never really seen the appeal of cricket), and it was against the ruddy Dogs no less!</p>

	<p>
	  Surely there would be no better introduction than watching <b>Reigning Premiers the East Fremantle Sharks</b> beat our arch-nemesis, I thought, and moreover it was a golden opportunity to introduce one of my good friends, who came over from China last year, to the national game.
	</p>

	<p>
	  On a lovely overcast, if a bit warm, day, I went out and met up with my friend and my boyfriend, and after spending some time at the Market, where I got my customary momo from Tibet Stove (I was surprised to realize I can half-read the menu now! My Dzongkha study is paying off.), we went down to hang out at South Beach for a while before coming back up just in time for the game to start at <time datetime="2024-03-02 16:40">4:40</time>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The crowd was fairly small, probably no more than 250 people, which is unfortunately less than 5% of the crowd that could be expected at a men’s Freo derby — but it was a crowd nonetheless, and as women’s footy continues to gain mainstream attention at the national level in the AFLW, surely some will trickle down to the state level women’s comp.
	</p>

	<p>
	  That being said, the small crowd gave the game an intimate community feel that is one of the things I love about WAFL footy, and I was happy to be there supporting my team against the old enemy, and supporting women’s footy in general. Despite clearly being in the early stages there is a real sense of being on the ground at the start of something big — it was heartwarming to see all the young girls at halftime enthusiastically taking up the sport.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The game itself was a low-scoring, scrappy affair that saw a lot of back and forth going on in the middle with little to show for it. Goals were hard to come by, and a goal by Souths late in the third quarter left the Sharks just a couple of points behind, setting up an incredibly tight final quarter.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The final quarter was when the game truly came into its own, with the Sharks in true East Freo fashion coming ahead with a mark and brilliant goal from about 35 out, and then nearly giving me a heart attack as the Bulldogs rushed forward repeatedly in a feverish attempt to regain the lead.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The Sharks defence was strong, however, and despite conceding a point, that goal ended up being enough to see the Sharks over the line as the whistle blew, winning in the end by 3 points, South Fremantle’s 3.7.25 to East Fremantle 4.4.28. The newly transferred Sarah Wielstra stood out to me for outstanding ruckwork which unfortunately was not capitalized on as fully as it could’ve been, and she promises to be a core player for the Sharks’ flag defence this year.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The young Zipporah ‘Zippy’ Fish, in addition to having one of the best footy names I have heard in a while, is being widely talked about as future AFLW material, and it’s not hard to see why, with how impressively she is playing at the age of only 17.
	</p>

	<p>
	  After enjoying the well-deserved victory, we headed back down to South Beach to stop at the Run Amuk for dinner. An incredibly cute little diner, it’s been on my list for ages, and the food and service certainly didn’t disappoint: the gloriously over the top hot dogs tasted as stunning as they looked, the spearmint milkshake was perfect and delightfully creamy, and we were served in such a lovely manner, all three of the staff coming out to us with our food simultaneously, that I felt like I was at a five star restaurant. To my mind, this one certainly was. ★★★★★

	<h3>Leaping onto the Web</h3>

	<p>The day has come! That special day, that doesn’t come around that often — it’s Leap Day!! When the last one of these happened, I was at home, reading about how the virus was spreading into Iran, Italy, and South Korea out of control... the death toll was rising, and the world was about to change completely.
	</p>

	<p><i>Ahem! Anyway —</i></p>

	<p>For this year’s Leap Day I also have a significant change in store, though I hope it’s less ‘coughy sneezy omen of looming apocalypse’ and more ‘fun and interesting addition to the vast sea of websites out there.’
	</p>

	<p>
	  Yes, that’s right, I am back online! After spending most of February feverishly brushing up on my HTML and CSS skills, selecting photos for publication, writing more poems, essays, and other pieces, tweaking, and editing, and doing some last minute debugging, I am finally ready to release my completely new and overhauled website to the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Leap Day isn’t a day that comes around often, and so what day could possibly be better to launch my website, one that I fully intend to be using until at least the next one. With this launch I am unveiling to the public years of work that I have never published before, and I am excited to finally have a proper platform to share the things I make with the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  My site may look a bit like something from the 1990s, but I think it has a certain charm, and there is nothing more satisfying than knowing that it is all the product of my own work. It has been lovingly handcrafted to the best of my abilities; from me to you, whoever happens to be reading this, whenever it happens to be read.
	</p>

	<p>
	  There is a lot of work still to be done on the site, of course: I have a history of Noongar language research that I have been meaning to write for some time now, the Asian languages section is currently empty and will take a long time to flesh out, the CSS and presentation have a lot of room for further tweaking... but I am satisfied enough with where it is to be happy to launch it into the world.
	</p>

	<p>
	  It is, after all, a work in progress, like life itself, and the real point of a living and dynamic website is not reaching some kind of ideal ‘finished’ state that will never be achieved, but rather the process of trying to get there itself.
	</p>

	<p><span lang="grc">Πάντα ῤεῖ.</span> Everything flows. It has been great fun making this website, and I hope there’ll be lots more fun to come before the next Leap Day comes around. — <i>Jenxolotl</i></p>

	<h3>The Rains Have Come!</h3>
	<p><time datetime="2024-02-25"><span class="date">2024-02-25</span></time></p>

	<p>
	  <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>The rains have come and pattered down<br>
	    Through the streets of my little town<br>
	    And soon will come back nature’s gloss<br>
	    The pretty flowers, lichens, and moss</p>

	  <p>As I sat down by the window yesterday morning to eat my toast, a wonderful sight greeted me: the sky was grey and the air was cool, and to my amazement I looked outside and saw a little puddle of water looking back at me!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Stepping outside I then realized that I had, in fact, left a tap loose when I'd watered the kaffir lime plant yesterday but, sure enough, moments later a faint pitter patter of rain started on the roof. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for me to stand out there for a good few moments grinning like an idiot, trying to catch as many drops as I could on my skin.
	  </p>

	  <p>Then I remembered that I had to go to work, ruing that I couldn’t spend the whole day outside, but at least I got to watch the rain come and go through the day.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I’ve never lost that childlike sense of wonder on seeing the rains come. And in a country like this, who can blame me? After, sometimes, going months on end without seeing a single drop of moisture, the return of the rain feels truly magical, like a long lost secret come back to restore all that is right and good to the world.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Just as I am starting to forget that rain is even possible, it returns, and with it the world changes completely in an instant. The air becomes rich with beautiful smells, the birds change their songs and movements, it feels pleasant, and even the light itself changes as everything becomes softened with a faint shadow.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The people will soon change, too. After months of complaining that the heat has been unbearable and they can’t wait for winter, they’ll soon change their tune and start complaining about how the rain is a pain and they can’t wait for some Sun again. These are the same people who complain about trees because the leaves fall on their lawns.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I almost can’t blame them — almost — for being so short-sighted, when society funnels people into working longer and harder for less pay, to the point that basic elements of life itself — the rain, trees, community — become seen as nuisances on the way to generating more profit for the ones in charge. But being trapped in a system doesn’t mean you need to support it. Indeed, there’s something wonderfully subversive about consciously taking a moment to appreciate the things that <i>don’t</i> obviously generate some kind of financial gain, whether those things be a rainy day, or a beautiful sunset, or even a cup of coffee with a good friend (and isn’t a rainy day a good day for it!).
	  <p>

	  <p>
	    To take a moment to appreciate the rain, is to defiantly insist on being human, against the overwhelming pressure to be a productive machine. To be bathed in it, enveloped by it, to become thoroughly soaked with it, is pure animal joy. The triumph of warm blood and goosebumped skin over cold logic, and the clock that never stops ticking.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    A returning customer absolutely made my day at work. I’d had a short talk with him a few weeks ago about the product that my company sells, and done the usual walk around, taking him through the showroom and discussing what our product does, how it can meet his requirements, and so on.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    It was a normal enough conversation, and I hadn’t thought too much about it until he came back recently with a big smile on his face. We talked about some work-related things, and of course since I recognized him I asked him how he was going and other stuff.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Still beaming, he told me that he’d been thinking of a change in careers: he had been working up north in FIFO for some time, but taking so many plane trips was starting to grind him down, and he was looking to do something different here in Perth.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Looking me in the eyes, he said that coming in a few weeks ago and seeing my smile, and feeling the positive energy that I gave off, had made a strong impression on him, and seeing my radiance was one of the things that really inspired him to go ahead and make a real change to his life: he wanted to start enjoying life more.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    I was absolutely chuffed by this: my job has a strong customer service element, and I feel that one of the reasons I thrive in jobs like mine is because my customer service work is underpinned by genuine empathy — a real desire to help other people with whatever it is they’ve come to me for. As he said, it felt powerful because he could tell it was genuine, and it is: my work personality is really not so different from how I am in my private life.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Hearing that my warmth and positivity was coming through in my role, to the point of inspiring others to live life more fully for themselves, is absolutely music to my ears. All I have ever wanted is to make the lives of others a little easier and a little more pleasant. I was beaming ear to ear myself when I thanked him, told him what a meaningful compliment that was to me, and wished him all the best in his life.
	  </p>

	  <p>—</p>

	  <p>
	    I get comments like this about my ‘aura’ once in a blue moon, and I suppose people pick up on my love of life, and my awareness; I remember being the darling of some lovely photographers a few years ago when I was doing a shoot for PrideWA's annual Pridefest event.
	  </p>
	  

	   <p> <q>Look at those eyes!</q></p>

	  <p><q>Wow, we have to use that!</q></p>

	  <p> 
	    The photographers adored my confidence, as I allowed myself to be fully absorbed by the silky sounds of the Pet Shop Boys and their prompts, becoming something more than just myself in the process of making a good photo, all while my eyes kept telling the truth of my own story — this is a shoot for Pride, and I am proud.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    If people take something from my energy, I hope that it’s there’s nothing special about me — it’s within you, too, and you’ll find it if you look.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The rain was gently falling outside while I was writing this, and now there is the peaceful lull right after it stops. A lone bird chirping, a damp patch on the road. A young tree swaying slowly in the breeze.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Earlier today I went outside and enjoyed it, looking up at the sky and allowing my glasses to become speckled with tiny raindrops. Now it’s time to hop outside again, for a cup of tea in the fresh air, enjoying what is left of the afternoon.

      <h3>Gathering Clouds, Collecting Drops</h3>
      <p><time datetime="2024-02-20"><span class="date">2024-02-20</span></time></p>

      <p>

	<p>It’s been a very long time since I attempted to keep an online diary like this - the last time I did it, Julia Gillard was the Prime Minister, and I was still in high school. At a time when I was still very much trapped inside of a seemingly impenetrable shell, I signed up to Blogger, and wrote my first post, which I think was called something like “The Light at the End of the Tunnel.”</p>

	<p>The tunnel was very dark then, and very long, but I must have caught the faintest glimmer that something could be different. My life might not actually be the life of unending loneliness and despair that I imagined for myself, back then. I could see a space for myself to exist.</p>

	<p>I wrote about the usual teenaged things, being lonely, feeling aimless, being supposedly misunderstood. I showed it to some of my classmates, and they were encouraging, and I liked it. I felt seen in a way that I hadn’t been before, and it was perhaps the first time I felt I could relate to the people around me. For their part, I had a reputation as a repressed and deathly shy loner, and I'm sure they were glad to see me open up, even a little bit.</p>

	<p>And then I stopped. My blog joined the vast graveyard of blogs that never went beyond their first post, and that was that. Life went on. And on, and on.</p>
	<p>How different everything is now! It took a while but I found that light, and now for the most part I live happily and quietly like everybody else: pursuing my hobbies and interests, spending time with my loved ones, exploring the vast world all around me.</p>

	<p>I still have worries, of course, but for the most part they are of the very material kind that everybody else has: how to keep food on the table and a roof over my head in the midst of an unprecedented rental and cost of living crisis. I see the people struggling all around me, and I feel lucky that I am in a place where my basic needs are being met.</p>

	<p>For the most part. I’m only human.</p>

	<p>As I write this, my back is getting drenched with sweat, and the prospect of rain feels remarkably distant. The clouds have come, yes, on 40+ degree days where it feels wrong for the sky to be so overcast, and the heat creates a suffocating air making Perth feel like some demented version of a tropical island, but they cruelly hold out on delivering the sweet and replenishing rain that almost makes these long dry summers worth it.</p>

	<p>When the rain comes and washes away the dust, it creates the most beautiful smell in the world. A rich, pregnant, earthy fragrance that fills the nostrils with the essence of home.</p>

	<p>The rain will come. The dust will be washed away.</p>

	<p>But for now it gathers a little longer.</p>
