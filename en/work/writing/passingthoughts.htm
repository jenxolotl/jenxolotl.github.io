      <h2>Passing Thoughts</h2>

      <div class="content">

      <p>
	I rolled over and felt a strange sensation: my sheets were damp all over. A warm, sickly substance clung to my body, sticking to my skin in airtight embrace. Writhing around to escape the uncomfortable feeling, I turned onto my back and opened my eyes in gradations. As the morning light resolved into an image, I could see what it was. Before me was an ocean of blood. It was soaked into the sheets in great swatches, darkening to a deep crimson as it congealed and dried. I threw off the covers and saw myself covered in it, and bit into my lip to suppress a scream.
      </p>

      <p>
	I darted out of bed and across the room, stepping over a pile of unwashed clothes left haphazardly on the floor. I got in the shower and turned the hot tap as far as it would go, waiting for a torrent of water to pour down and cleanse me of this filth. The droplets came down and splashed across my face, pooling in my eyes like the tears of a wounded beast. Thick clots of blood clung to tangled hairs, trickling down and creeping along the ceramic tiles until they made their exit down the drain with a sickening gurgle. The sound sent a chill down my already shivering spine. I was enveloped by the rising plumes of steam but I still felt cold.
	</p>

      <p>
	I scrubbed myself hard for what felt like half an hour but, even though the physical remains washed away, the feeling stuck with me. After a last determined thrust I stepped out of the shower, looking down as I did to make sure that nothing was left visible. I stepped over to the mirror and in it I saw a naked, contorted wretch. Now, with no covering to hide its flaws, I saw what a disgusting creature it truly was.  I stepped up and put my face up close against the glass, looked deep into its piercing eyes and saw nothing but a black void. The effect was hypnotic, and I felt that I could become lost forever in the boundless darkness. I snapped out of my trance and checked my reflection. No blood, but the sunken eyelids betrayed a man who couldn’t sleep. Or, perhaps, one who couldn’t wake up.
      </p>

      <p>
	I stared at myself in the reflection, hoping to see a lingering glimmer of humanity. I had been at work for nearly eight hours and had accomplished little of note. The words on the screen appeared before my eyes as a long string of meaningless symbols; after what had happened the world had stopped making sense to me. I sat beneath a harsh white light, alone in a featureless square, awaiting news of my fate. I could hear voices talking in muffled tones on the other side of the walls, one person speaking then the other replying after a moment’s pause. I wondered how much they knew. I wondered if the scene playing back over and over in my mind would be exposed in my darting eyes, or in the slight tremble on my lip. Finally, the door flung open. A large, imposing figure strutted out and uttered my name in a way that makes water freeze.
	</p>

      <p><i>Come into my office. Now please.</i></p>

      <p>
	I got up and began the walk the shame across the room. The voices had stopped and every step I took echoed across the cavernous hallway. With each thud the doorway grew larger and larger. I didn’t dare to look back and show all the staring faces the fear in my eyes. Everybody wears a mask in the office but nothing can hide what I have seen. I entered the black widow’s lair, ready to be devoured. He lay in wait, and as I entered he beckoned for me to sit down, after I close the door behind me.
      </p>
      
      <i><p>
Now listen, kid. It seems we’ve got a little problem on our hands.<br>
The code you’ve been writing lately, it’s… frankly it’s garbage. The stuff you wrote last week, it was so bad that John had to throw it out and rewrite it himself.<br>
Now, John, he has his own work to do. He fixed your code in his own time. His own time. He has a wife and family… he can’t be saving your ass all the time.<br>
So, tell me. What’s gotten into you lately? You used to be such a great kid, so talented, full of enthusiasm! What happened?
      </p></i>
      
      <p>
	I sat there watching his lips move furiously. My thoughts were far from the ceaseless sequence of sounds coming from his mouth. I thought about the crumpled sheets lying all day in the summer heat, with flies crawling over the crusted stains. I thought about whether the neighbours would notice the smell. His last question momentarily brought me back to reality; I murmured a vague apology.
      </p>

      <p>
	Sorry doesn’t pay my bills! I need good, clean, code from you! Do you hear me? Sort yourself out and do your damn work properly, or your next task will be cleaning out your desk!
      </p>
      
      <p>
	I walked out of his office and past the solemn faced jury of my peers. I felt as if I had been teleported in from another dimension: they were completely oblivious to my real problems.  The boss’s threats didn’t concern me in the slightest. A spent cartridge cannot be fired again.
      </p>

      <p>
	I entered the city’s main artery and began the long drive back to my house. I was feeling aimless: there was nothing left for me there, but there was nowhere else for me to go. So I drove back towards the scene of the crime, the place of all my joys and sorrows, where laughter had rung out in the day and tears were shed in the night, intense passions growing and changing and ensnaring until the fateful climax; I looked at the beach, as the waves crested and broke back in the tide. The setting Sun bled out its final rays on the Pacific coast, tinting everything a deep red hue. I put my foot on the brake as the traffic in front of me slowed, and then stopped at an intersection. It was deadlock. I and all the other drivers coming home sat waiting for the signal above to change, and grant us release. I looked across the highway at the people around me, all sitting still in their metal boxes. They were a fair cross-section of society: young, old, men, women, blacks, whites, Latinos and Asians. I reflected for a moment on how these people all had their own fully fleshed out lives. They all had lives completely separate to my own: stories that I would never hear. I appreciated the few seconds I had as part of this big crowd that stretched back as far as I could see. The lights changed and I continued on my journey.
      </p>

      <p>
	I pulled up in the driveway shortly after 9PM. My wife stood waiting for me out on the front porch. Her eyes and smile lit up like stars and the crescent moon as I stepped out of the car and met her tender gaze. Seeing her released all the tension in my body, and I felt like a new man. I went inside and everything was as I remembered it. We ate dinner together while watching the news. The same old depressing stories flashed before our eyes: economy tanking, crime on the rise, some murder-suicide in the suburbs. I turned the TV off and we went to bed together. I took my wife in my arms and went to sleep.
