      <h2>The Club</h2>

      <p>It was a cold, dark night. It was 10PM and the streets were completely empty, devoid of all life except for her. The soft rain shimmered faintly in the dim glow of the streetlights. A lone black car goes driving past, emerging from the darkness and disappearing just as suddenly.
      </p>
      
      <p>
It must belong to the MDS, or Ministry of Domestic Security. They are always watching, hidden in the darkness like some predator waiting to pounce. Acting to protect the people, or so they say.
She keeps walking until she reaches her destination. On the outside it’s nothing special; just another featureless concrete slab in an endless sea of grey. A sign says “Joey’s Used Bookstore” They’re closed.
      </p>

      <p>
	She knocks anyway, with a specific timing. The door opens and she moves quickly inside.
      </p>

      <p>
	The interior is seemingly just as non-descript as the exterior; rows of bookshelves with a counter in the corner. The lights are turned off and it is completely dark: it is a closed bookstore.
      </p>

      <p>
	But this place is different; it holds a great secret, a hidden treasure. She goes behind the counter, opening a door leading into the backroom. Descending the staircase into the basement, a glimpse of the old world is revealed, a flashback to days gone by. An oasis of freedom in a vast desert.
      </p>

      <p>
	In this small basement there is music playing; strobe lights flashing and people dancing. Off to the sides there are people chatting over drinks.
      </p>

      <p>
	She thinks back 15 years, to around her 18th birthday. Going to the bars, restaurants and clubs around the vibrant city plaza.
      <p>

      <p>
	When such things were legal, and the city was thriving. At this point the war had already began in the North, but it still seemed so distant and removed then.
      </p>

      <p>
	Three years later the city lay in ruins. The war had reduced everything to rubble. The famous nightlife had been totally destroyed. In its place the lifeless concrete slabs of the new regime sprung up. A city designed for heartless efficiency and soulless functionality.
      </p>

      <p>
	Leaving only underground clubs such as these, keeping the spirit of the old city alive.
      </p>

      <p>
	There was trouble in the club tonight. A large group of suited men entered suddenly. The MDS.
      </p>

      <p>
	They’ve come to shut down this place down. How did they find out about it?
	</p>

      <p>
	Is there an informant? Or did they just get lucky?
	</p>

      <p>
	It doesn’t matter now. Everyone begins to panic as the government agents stream in. In the pandemonium she sees a small window to the outside and crawls through it. And she runs, as far away as she possibly can. Nothing can be done to save the club now, it’s too late.
	</p>

      <p>
	She eventually stops running. She hears gunshots, and sees an orange glow and smoke in the distance. The club is gone now.
	</p>

      <p>
	The next week she is walking down the street when a stranger passing by hands her a slip of paper.
	</p>

      <p>
	On it is written an address. A new location. They can shut down as many clubs as they want. As long as there’s people like her around the underground will always live on.
