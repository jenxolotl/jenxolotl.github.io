      <h2>The Renters (Pt. I)</h2>

      <div class="content">

      <p>
	The line stretched long and far back in the heat of
the mid-day Sun, snaking its way between
overgrown utes and little boxed off lawns that didn’t
	look fit to hold a flamingo.
      </p>

      <p>
“God, it’s hot today”, said Mitch, wiping away the
forming beads of sweat on his brow as he walked to
join the back of the line with his partner, Michelle.
      </p>

      <p>
	“We should’ve gone earlier.”
      </p>

      <p>
Michelle, water bottle in hand and wearing a wide-
brimmed hat of the kind you see people wear in trips
to the Zoo, looked at his overly exposed figure with a
kind of mildly disappointed compassion.
      </p>

      <p>
“This was the only slot they had left today; c’mon, it
won’t be too long.”
      </p>

      <p>
They went around a corner and took their place
against a tall blue Colourbond fence, huddling as
the others were against a slim sliver of shadow.
      </p>

      <p>
	“At least we’ve got a bit of shade here.”
      </p>

      <p>
Along the street the house was on, there were more
real estate signs than trees, and the few trees that
were, were little more than saplings that the sunlight
pierced with ease. A short stumpy hedge along one of the homes was
the closest thing there was to an approximation of
shelter, and a group of people huddled under it like a
	cluster of refugees.
      </p>

      <p>
There were all kinds of people waiting in the line,
from old to young, and even a few children. There
were Indian and African women in their colourful
clothes, suit-wearing businessmen with wives in
form fitting dresses that matched the colour of their
ties, middle-aged bogans with Southern Cross
tattoos and KISS singlets, a few tradies still in their
bright yellow work-shirts, and even a couple of
goths with colourful highlights in their hair, and
eyes adorned with black shadow.
      </p>

      <p>
All looked uncomfortable to some greater or lesser
degree, as some chatted and laughed, some tried to
keep cool by fanning themselves, a few Mums
watched over thankfully quiet babies, and most were
on their phones, scrolling through Insta or
rechecking the rental listing.
      </p>

      <p>
That is what Michelle was doing as the line crawled
forward at a glacial pace, while the melting ferocity
of the Sun remained unrelenting. Looking over her shoulder as he tried to distract
himself, Mitch piped up:
      </p>

      <p>
“Five hundred and fifty a week for a place like this.
It’s ridiculous, it’s basically my entire paycheck.”
      </p>

      <p>
	“Yeah it’s crazy, but it’s still cheaper than most these
days. We’ve got my pay so we’ll be OK. I feel bad for
the people doing this by themselves, I don’t know
	how…”
      </p>

      <p>
	“… yeah …”, Mitch agreed solemnly.
      </p>

      <p>
“It’s been hard enough for us to find a place, I can’t
imagine how some of these people are going to get
by.”
      </p>

      <p>
His eyes drifted along the line, as if to say that some
of the people standing with them had a tragic fate in
store.
It had been impossible not to notice the change in
Perth over the past few years. The spectre of homelessness loomed ever present
over the city, as the doorways of the damned became
full of people in ragged beds, and tents started
popping up in hidden places in beaches and parks. The Canning Bridge intersection had become a
bazaar of desperation as people sold their window
washing services, and it was impossible to travel far
without seeing signs of misery.
      </p>

      <p>
That spectre had seemed something distant to Mitch
and Michelle, but now that their end of lease was
coming, with them still not having a new place to
stay, the haunting fear loomed ever so slightly closer.
      </p>

      <p>
The heat continued to bear down on them
relentlessly, as the skin on Mitch’s arms started to
turn red and the line continued to creep slowly
forwards.
      </p>

      <p>
	“At least it’s a new place.”
      </p>

      <p>
	Up ahead there were sudden gasps.
      </p>

      <p>
As people stood back, it became clear that one of the
Indian women had collapsed on the footpath.
      </p>

      <p>
	“Oh my God”
      </p>

      <p>
Armed with her water bottle, Michelle went forward
to assist. She crouched down beside the woman with
a few others, including a man who seemed to be her
husband.
      </p>

      <p>
	“My God, wake up darling, wake up!”
      </p>

      <p>
Michelle took a cloth from her bag and damped
some water onto it, placing it on the woman’s sun-
blanched forehead.
      </p>

      <p>
At this moment a woman strode forward, saying
“Hey, I’m a nurse, what’s going on?”
      </p>

      <p>
She told the crowd to stand back slightly, as the
woman turned her head slowly, opening her eyes
with a pained expression. Michelle watched as the nurse and the man gently
helped her sit up, explaining to her that she had just
	fainted, and moved her to a nearby brick wall.
      </p>

      <p>
The line had barely moved as Michelle went back to
Mitch to resume their long wait. The Sun continued to blaze down on them,
unmoved by their plight.
      </p>

      <p>
After about twenty more minutes of waiting,
Michelle and Mitch finally reached the head of the
queue, just after one in the afternoon, where they
were greeted by the broad grin of the rental
salesman, teeth porcelain white like a freshly cleaned
toilet bowl.
      </p>

      <p>
“Hi nice to meet you I’m David”, he said as he
confidently thrust his hand forward into the gap
between them.
      </p>

      <p>
Not a hair on his head was out of place, in contrast
to the growing pools of sweat under Michelle’s arms,
while Mitch was well and truly starting to look like a
slice of watermelon left out on a table just a bit too
long.
      </p>

      <p>
Michelle took the offered shake, introducing herself
and her partner.
      </p>

      <p>
“Sorry about the wait, we’ve had a lot of interest in
this property.”, the agent said as he led them said
inside.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh no, looks like you got a bit sunburnt!”</p>

      <p>
“Yeah… I probably should’ve used some sunscreen…”
Mitch sheepishly admitted.
      </p>

      <p>
“There’s some water over there if you need it.”; the
agent gestured to a water cooler with some paper
cups.
      </p>

      <p>
“As you can see, it is a very new property, with
modern facilities throughout; it was built only six
months ago, and the landlord intends to use it as an
investment property. It has two bedrooms, two
bathrooms including the master on-suite, and a
comfortable open plan living area – if you have any
questions just let me know – hi my name is David,
nice to meet you…”
      <p>

	<p>
Almost in a singular motion, the agent swung
around and began repeating his mantra to the next
couple.
	</p>

	<p>
Left to look around, Mitch and Michelle went into
the strangely dog-legged combined living and
kitchen area: the double carport had obviously taken
a lot of the floor-plan.
	</p>

	<p>
The kitchen was tucked away in a little nook, and
out the windows either side were magnificent views
of grey fences, with a sliver of blue sky for optimism.
	</p>

	<p>
“It feels like a prison”, Mitch confided safely out of
earshot.
	</p>

	<p>“At least it doesn’t have mould in the walls like your
	  old place.”
	</p>

	<p>
“At least I could actually see some nature in my old
place! … It was a shit-hole, though.”
	</p>

	<p>
“It was. I know it’s a bit small, but it’s as good as we
can get these days.”
	</p>

	<p>
As good as we can get was starting to become a
mantra of its own, words to live by, but to live was
becoming hard enough.
	</p>

	<p>
	  “Mitch!”, Michelle shouted from her office.
	</p>

	<p>
“I just got an email, we got approved for that place
down south!”
	</p>

	<p>
	  “Fuck yeah! Jesus, it came just in time…”
	</p>

	<p>
Mitch could not finish his sentence before being
taken up by Michelle’s arms. Her tears were already
flowing.
	</p>

	<p>
“We’ve got a place, we don’t need to worry anymore!
They’ve even offered us a 12 month lease – 12
months!”
	</p>

	<p>
	  “Aww, you’re gonna make me start crying too!”
	</p>

	<p>
The two stood amidst the packing boxes in a long
embrace. They were safe, for at least a while longer.
	</p>
