      <h2>Remembering the Kakulas Bros Warehouse Fire</h2>

      <p>
	A year ago now, the day before Valentine’s, Perth
was set ablaze by the sight of thick black smoke
	rising from somewhere in the heart of the city.
      </p>

      <p>
My boyfriend and I had been driving up the
Kwinana Freeway to have lunch with a friend at an
Afghan restaurant, when we started seeing
ambulances and fire engines racing towards the city. They came one after the other, lights blazing, and the tension rose in my chest as I realized something
big must be happening. We could only speculate on what it was until the
road rose up a little, and we saw the single plume
rising from somewhere behind the Perth skyline.
      </p>

      <p>
My heart sunk immediately. My boyfriend suggested
that it could be a bushfire, but I knew from looking
how acrid and concentrated the smoke was, and
where it was coming from, that it could only be a
building fire somewhere in the city itself.
It was hard not to imagine the worst as the
emergency vehicles continued to race past, lights
blazing. The smoke loomed over us as we approached
the city, and on the bridge to Kings Park we saw a
group of Woodside protesters dressed as Grim
Reapers, dangling a banner about the climate crisis.
      </p>

      <p>
	We wondered aloud whether they were aware of the
disaster right behind them.
Entering the Mitchell Freeway, we started to see
ambulances racing down southbound too. We
turned the car around, told our friend we would be
	late, and went into the city to investigate.
      </p>

      <p>
	We parked in Northbridge as close as we safely could
and walked a short distance on foot, to find the
usually quiet residential area by William Street
	engulfed in grey, awful smelling smoke.
      </p>

      <p>
	Firefighters and news crews were barely visible in the
smoke and steam, as local onlookers huddled in the
shadow of the Perth Mosque, covering their faces
	with their clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
	The wind was blowing the smoke towards us and the
firefighters told us to get back, so we headed back
down a neighbouring street, where we could see the
cranes spraying water on the blaze only metres away.
Police officers were going door to door, informing
	residents they needed to evacuate.
      </p>

      </fig>

      <p>
	We reached the southern end of the street, where we
took shelter in what had obviously become the
media encampment. TV news journalists from the
major channels and their crews looked on at the
	unfolding pandemonium.

      <p>
	Evan Kakulas, the third generation son of Kakulas
Bros, was discussing the situation with the
emergency services in his shirt and shorts. Fire units
continued to arrive on scene, and firefighters carried
oxygen and other equipment toward the burning
	warehouse.
      </p>

      <p>
	There were dozens of fire, police, ambulance and city
ranger vehicles crowded into the closed roads around
the site. I’d never seen so many emergency vehicles
in my life. Fire engines and Specialised Equipment Tenders were coming from places as
	far as Gosnells and Murdoch.
      </p>

      </fig>

      <p>
	A media representative for DFES came out to give us
a pre-briefing, saying they would be available for
questions in half an hour. Preliminarily he informed
us that the blaze was contained but not under
control, was of an unknown cause, and all warehouse
employees had been accounted for.
Relieved that there had been no casualties, and with
friends waiting for us, we concluded our
investigation and went up to meet out friends for the
late lunch.
The Kabuli pulao was excellent, as always.
On the way home that evening, we happened to pass
a DFES command vehicle that was also driving back,
	the fire having been successfully extinguished.
      </p>

      </fig>

      <p>
	I found myself walking past the site again four
months later, and by this time there was nothing
left to see of what had been the old, dingy, graffiti-covered warehouse.
      </p>

      <p>
	With the fortunate fact that no lives were lost, the
incident has been quickly forgotten, and Kakulas
Brothers continues operation from its prominent
storefront near the corner of William St and Roe.
It is unlikely that many people will be remembering
the Kakulas Warehouse fire one year on, but on the
day, it could be seen all over Perth, and you could see
everywhere the looks of uncertain dread as people
	imagined the possibilities.
