      <h2>Gaza, a fragment</h2>

      <div class="content">

      <p>
	When the rockets flew overhead in their thousands<br>
Crossing the clear sky unimpeded<br>
By the checkpoints, barriers, booklets, and bullets<br>
	That pin down our aspirations
      </p>
      
      <p>
For a moment I felt the joy of liberation<br>
Of fences falling and people surging free<br>
To be themselves, the great release<br>
Of a century of suppressed feelings
      </p>

      <p>
	The realization of our common dream
      </p>
      

      <p>
يا فلسطين بلادي<br>
من البحر إلى النهر<br>
يا فلسطين الحبيبة<br>
سوف تكون حرة
      </p>


      <p>
A fantasy in high-explosive Technicolour<br>
Coming to you live in never before seen revolution<br>
A flurry of harmless firecrackers ringing in<br>
The New Year for all the people cheering
      </p>

      <p>
It was the forceful kick of those who longed to breathe<br>
And when I saw it connect to the face of<br>
The occupiers, I felt that strength and blinked<br>
And saw again that smoke would rise
      </p>

      <p>
	To choke the toxic air;<br>
Soaring lights would surely fall<br>
Hurting when they hit the ground<br>
My God, they’ll kill them all
      </p>

      <p>
While we sit like dazed idiots<br>
Chained to the indifference of our screens<br>
Softly sobered by the gravity of it all<br>
International Relations, a game of white men
      </p>

      <p>
Always pressing down and forcing pins and lines<br>
On our soft spots, of the human kind<br>
I barely had time to mourn the coming dead<br>
Ideals of kibbutzim, lost in time
      </p>

      <p>
On the straight path from Pearl Harbour to Okinawa<br>
The pain multiplying in kind as no mercy<br>
Becomes a virtue, a decency extinguished<br>
With the wail of sirens and cries of loved ones
      </p>
      
      <p>
The crushing sound of bulldozers rolling in<br>
And pencilled lines on old paper maps;<br>
A tsunami of blood about to flow<br>
From the sky and drown the whole
      </p>

      <p>
Of Palestine, my country, in the red sea of tears<br>
The lingering hope once again giving way to fear<br>
As the tide recedes, and we all brace<br>
For the coming wave, the new storm of steel
      </p>

      <p>
Rising and leaving Gaza in its shadow, a husk<br>
To be swept away to make a point about what is<br>
Right, the mass murder of others, the bombs<br>
Won’t leave a mark in broken homes, lives left in dark
      </p>

      <p>
But the city always had colour to me<br>
Growing up, and seeing the parallel lines<br>
Running between the story of their home and mine<br>
Exploding to get out of the stifling silence
      </p>

      <p>
The quiet violence of unmentionable things<br>
Surging through the vessels of life, our worlds<br>
Meeting in the eyes of my friend, the future doctor
      </p>
      
      <p>
Her pride evident in the pretty picture and proper<br>
Decor, her photogenic smile,  still filling me with warmth<br>
Though it's been a while since we talked, her words<br>
<q>I want to be a doctor so I can help Palestine</q>
      </p>

      <p>
Still ring in my ears, and I wish she could’ve stayed<br>
In my life, though I don’t know which is better,<br>
The sudden violence of the blast or the long sadness<br>
Whether she is at al-Shifa or some other hospital
      </p>

      <p>
Or by the gates of Rafah, still trapped<br>
With only her strength of spirit to give her peace<br>
In a world where family is a liability and<br>
Talent targeted by the roaming fighter jets
      </p>
      
      <p>
That seek with the tap of a screen to block out<br>
The stories of generations, still drowning out<br>
The droning bombs that never cease, in the news,<br>
Her fate the fate of Palestine, and I love her still
      </p>   

      <p>
As when I met her and felt her blood pumping<br>
Through the copper veins, the network of an unjust world<br>
That keeps us together despite the effort to cut it all away<br>
To make us silent in ourselves as the killing carries on
      </p>

      <p>
All around, my solitude is over and I see her<br>
Every time I read the lines on people’s faces<br>
Her words and smile still shaping my view<br>
More than a decade on, the genocide rages
      </p>

      <p>
Unabated, and hers is just one of the multitude<br>
Of treasures, the antique vases and intricate<br>
Mosaics of living things that thoroughly underlie a place<br>
Torn between empires for ten thousand years,
      </p>

      <p>
A land in the corner where the people suffer most<br>
For the sins of distant leaders, and colonial misadventure<br>
The belief that Arab blood is inferior<br>
Makes the cities glow red like Roman glass
      </p>

      <p>
And Greek bird tiles, recently unearthed<br>
I wonder if anything could remain<br>
In a place where every street is combed over<br>
With gunshots and the roads are filled with graves
      </p>

      <p>
As the children’s names compete for space<br>
In the walls of text, denser than<br>
The calligraphy lost in ruined mosques<br>
And no less the tragedy than the adults
      </p>

      <p>
Their bodies piled high upon the spoiled flour<br>
The desperate hunt for love and sustenance<br>
As Israelis shoot them like ducks in a circus game<br>
The Americans the ringleaders twirling their batons
      </p>

      <p>
As the world, dazzled by the spectacle, moves on<br>
And swipes on, another clip, to the next gasp<br>
Cruelly saying ‘never again’ before it even ends<br>
The blood from Arab lands spilling over the fence
      </p>

      <p>
A drop on every hand, a drop gone from the rainbow<br>
Sea of life in Gaza, Palestine, precious world<br>
Their goal to make it something like Haifa<br>
A city stripped of history and people
      </p>

      <p>
To be a tourist trap for outsiders<br>
The Disney version of what is safe<br>
For investors, populated by fugitives<br>
In shattered homes and stolen houses
      </p>

      <p>
I just want to see the murder stop<br>
So the surviving kids can play<br>
Again, the adults rebuild<br>
Dreams from ashes
      </p>

      <p>
To see their elders dip their toes<br>
In the waters of forbidden shores.
      </p>
