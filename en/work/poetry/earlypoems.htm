      <h2>Early Poems (2014-2016)</h2>
      <div class="content">
      <p>
	Presented below is a selection of early poems from when I first started writing poetry regularly on the eve of my twentieth birthday. I had always liked poetry in the few places I had encountered it, and I remember writing the odd haiku in high school, but, as with many people, I started to write more frequently at a time when I was struggling with my life circumstances — coming of age, the end of school and concomitant loss of structure, severe agoraphobia, trauma, and depression — as a form of therapeutic outlet.
      </p>

      <p>
	I was heavily influenced by the English Romantics at the time, perhaps as much by the idea of them as their poetry itself, as I found in them temporally distant kindred spirits to project my own pained experience of the world upon.
      </p>

      <p>
	As with much poetry-as-therapy, a lot of my early work was self-indulgent doggerel. Perhaps my work is still self-indulgent even now, but I would hope it is much less dreadful to read.
      </p>

      <p>
	That being said, I can see the beginnings of my development as a poet in some of the better pieces from that period, provided below; I am particularly still fond of ‘Inundation’, which I think captures well the feelings I had at the time, and is very interesting to juxtapose with the images of nature found in my more recent poetry, and also of ‘Snowflakes on a Quiet Evening’, where I can see some of my underlying playfulness: I believe I was aware of the somewhat florid and ponderously self-serious nature of much of my early poetry, and had written it in the spirit of self-parody.
      </p>

      <p>
	‘2011-03-11’, my response to the Tōhoku Tsunami on its fifth anniversary, presaged a more dynamic and liberated approach to language which continues to evolve in my more recent poems. It is a fitting final piece for this small gathering of leaves, as I ceased to write poetry almost completely shortly thereafter, my preoccupations turning elsewhere, and I did not return to poetic writing for a full Olympic cycle, until the beginning of this decade.
