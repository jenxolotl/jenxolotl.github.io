      <h2>Birth</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
	<p>
	  I entered this world not far from here<br>
In a little hospital on the edge<br>
By the big brackish lakes,<br>
	  Vast shimmering planes
	  </p>

	<p>
A little past three,<br>
Assisted in the exit by<br>
A Sri Lankan medic whom<br>
My mother never quite forgave
	</p>

	<p>
First breath by the dawn<br>
Of sterile hospital air<br>
I had scarcely seen light<br>
When I was back on a flight
	</p>

	<p>
To the rich red earth<br>
And dust draped domiciles<br>
Of Newman, a bastion<br>
In the State’s far North.
	</p>

	<p>
Stranger among strangers in a strange land<br>
Where men worshipped a big hole in the sand<br>
Scar-streaked and ravished<br>
The hole in my heart
	</p>

	<p>
	  Surrounded by endless, distant expanse.
	</p>

	<p>
This was my home<br>
And I looked up at the trucks,<br>
Blocking the Sun,<br>
With childish awe
	</p>

	<p>
The monstrous machines<br>
And trains without end<br>
Take on dimensions<br>
Stretched beyond my horizons.
	</p>

	<p>
This would be my hole to descend<br>
But my limit was the hill<br>
Of ants down the road
	</p>
	
	<p>
I loved the dust, and dirt,<br>
And dry spinifex brush
	</p>

	<p>
The cyclonic rains<br>
Made mud, and dry cracked plates<br>
Willy willies, all<br>
Spinning in the ravine of civilization
	</p>

	<p>
I saw them clearly<br>
In the cracks<br>
Outside the barbecued verandahs<br>
And sprinkled lawns
	</p>

	<p>
That defined our society,<br>
Defying the norms and living betwixt<br>
Old burnt out wrecks and<br>
Broken bottles and barrels
	</p>

	<p>
On the fringe<br>
Between the new rubber-footed order<br>
And the greens, and reds<br>
And crumbled bone-whites
	</p>

	<p>
Of unimaginably ancient land,<br>
Calling me out to the great<br>
Rainbow world beyond.
	</p>

	<p>
I saw them out there,<br>
The Other Ones,<br>
Like me but black in skin<br>
And poor, with bottle in hand
	</p>

	<p>
I looked to my elders for support<br>
Not knowing the reasons<br>
Behind glowering stares<br>
Harsh words said in malice;
	</p>

	<p>
Abdication of responsibility and<br>
Moral cowardice
	</p>

	<p>
They told me to keep away,<br>
That the world was my ant hill<br>
But the seed was planted<br>
And my trust was broken.
	</p>

	<p>
I was too young, then<br>
And did not cross the curtain<br>
Before returning with parents<br>
To blue-watered Rockingham
	</p>
	
	<p>
Mooriburdup, always<br>
The birthplace I’d forgotten
	</p>

	<p>
A white spirit of the dead lost<br>
In the land between two countries<br>
Between two salt lakes, silent<br>
And the incredible sea beyond.
	</p>

	<p>
An alien now<br>
In the land I was born
	</p>

	<p>
I felt alone from everyone<br>
Sitting and crying on the floor of a bus<br>
Berated by old men, and the gawking stares<br>
Of wide-eyed schoolchildren.
	</p>

	<p>
Precocious before his age<br>
An adult in a boy’s body<br>
Terrible things to say to a child<br>
Who doesn't know whether she’s coming
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Or going to an inferno
	</p>

	<p>
In a world of fences, and barbed wire<br>
Car tyres screeching through the night<br>
Standardized tests and clocks slowed to a crawl<br>
The clink of piled beer bottles
	</p>

	<p>
Drowning the calls of crows and cowed wives<br>
Lost in a suburban cacophony
	</p>
	
	<p>
Dying in White, working-class<br>
Hegemony.
	</p>

	<p>
I could not be one of them.<br>
But what else could I be?
	</p>

	<p>
Nothing.<br>
No one.
	</p>
	
	<p>
A congealed speck of grease, sitting<br>
In an unwashed pan.
	</p>

	<p>
The darkness, blackness, swept over me<br>
Like the pounding, unyielding waves at sea<br>
What is a home if not a prison<br>
What is a promise if not a lie
	</p>

	<p>
	  Nowhere and nothing
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  I gasped for air, struggling to catch<br>
My breath, eyes darkened with despair<br>
Trapped behind the doors, cheap meals<br>
	  Panic attacks at sports fairs
	  </p>

	<p>
	  Short breath found again
	</p>

	<p>
In the kindness of too few friends<br>
Family visits, in smoky homes<br>
The old books, and pictures<br>
Of unfamiliar flags from places unknown
	</p>

	<p>
Sleepwalking through the saltlicked land<br>
My eyes blind to the burning Sun<br>
The blood of Lancelot and Guinevere<br>
Running through me, far away
	</p>

	<p>
The dark and endless depths<br>
Of a world wide web, undaunted,<br>
Beckoned to me to come<br>
Like the red rock and spinifex
	</p>

	<p>
Stretching to the horizon<br>
Ensnaring me in its net<br>
Like a seductive red back<br>
Of infinite meaning
	</p>

	<p>
Under the stars; in the glow<br>
Of the computer’s early light.
	</p>

	<p>
My world was a room.<br>
My world was a sea of bits that<br>
Could be arranged into<br>
Any pattern of my choosing
	</p>

	<p>
If only I knew to hold that power<br>
Without abusing the fragile folds<br>
Of my mind, happy memories of Sun<br>
And soil overwritten, physicality denied
	</p>

	<p>
Without the blistering heat outside,<br>
The walls and fences of my world<br>
Came tumbling down into<br>
Cognitive void.
	</p>

	<p>
Everything and nothing<br>
Everywhere and nowhere<br>
Soon the names of every King of England<br>
And some Queens came quick to my lips but
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  They remained parched of the taste of life.
	</p>
	
	<p>
How they became cracked and stained<br>
By the dirt all around, shit on the ground<br>
Still dogging me, disturbed, too sick to breathe<br>
In a changing world, the light of childhood
	</p>

	<p>
	  Fast fading out
	</p>

	<p>
And growing the embarrassment, the first black hairs<br>
That I hid feverishly, the signs of my shame<br>
Full difference from the others, all changing<br>
Budding breasts and broken voices, getting tall together
	</p>

	<p>
Like the barbed wire barriers, holding us all<br>
Back in, the threat of violence, the blood spilling<br>
On concrete and rushing to my ears, the boys shouted<br>
Faggot, as I swam beneath the water
	</p>

	<p>
	  To avoid the girls’ gaze.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Lungs burning, eyes aching from looking<br>
For the gleam of knives in pant pockets, the grey<br>
Of locks on school gates, the cute smiles chained away<br>
Of boys, and the girls too scary to consider
	</p>

	<p>
A reality of constant terror<br>
Between the darkness;<br>
First light.
	</p>

	<p>
The coming of the dawn again<br>
Life found in the formation of bits<br>
Mutuality across an intangible divide
	</p>

	<p>
Japan, a much grander place than Rockingham<br>
To sense deprived eyes an alternative<br>
To nine holes in the ground,<br>
Six feet down, sixteen years past
	</p>

	<p>
A former golf course could not compare<br>
To the grandeur of castles<br>
And glimmering Shibuya<br>
In the City of Light
	</p>
	
	<p>
I made friends anew, new furrows in the Earth<br>
And soon replaced suburban mundanity<br>
With nascent transnational sublimity,<br>
At least in the corners of my mind,
	</p>

	<p>
A useless thing in a body bounded<br>
By four walls and a little bird fountain<br>
In a garden of regret.
	</p>

	<p>
I had to break out, before I rolled over<br>
I had to break out, but a leap into fantasy
	</p>

	<p>
Is a leap against gravity<br>
Back into the deep pools of life<br>
Darkness, re-emergent
	</p>

	<p>
Despite the depths of Lake Biwa, the rolling<br>
Stock sounds of Osaka, running past the clear<br>
Shimanto river, and still looking further,<br>
Afar, for the signs of something better
	</p>

	<p>
From Sakhalin, to Kalmykia, to the far<br>
Familiar deserts of our own, the Navajo Plateau,<br>
I looked and kept looking, finding without<br>
Finding, across the other shore, the calm
	</p>

	<p>
In new China, and there I stayed, for years more,<br>
Growing without growing, my life a glass house<br>
Taking greedily the rays, and waiting for the stone<br>
To shatter it all
	</p>

	<p>
	  Ah, ah
	</p>

	<p>
Break me into pieces and cure me<br>
With your body, beyond description<br>
I lived high through you for years<br>
In the clouds of your mind, hurting
	</p>

	<p>
	  In your own way
	</p>

	<p>
Together in pain for a while, basking in<br>
The calm before a storm that never came<br>
The dream of electricity dying<br>
As I grew older and opened my eyes,
	</p>

	<p>
Emerging slowly into the light, a newborn child<br>
Been around the world too many times to count<br>
A tired young body, inquisitive blue eyes<br>
Out by the brackish lakes, and ready
	</p>

	<p>
To understand the image in the mirror:<br>
A natural delivery.
