      <h2>Bus Beach Comet</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
	<p>
	  Riding the 549 to Freo with you<br>
That one time, I could see past<br>
The blue-green scrub and shipbuilding yards,<br> 
	  Sparks flying from the doors
	</p>

	<p>
To see that you would go<br>
Clean past this place, someday<br>
It was a mystery to me how you ended up<br>
In this far flung corner,
	</p>

	<p>
	  Far from the fifteen storey department stores and<br>
	  Nightlife in infinite colours<br>
	  Like a bloom of algae spreading<br>
	  Across the local pond.
	</p>

	<p>
I remember your first day off the plane,<br>
Going to the chic clothes stores in Subiaco,<br>
Like you already knew the who’s who<br>
Throughout this sandblasted land.
	</p>

	<p>
Off to the beach to meet your Frenchies,<br>
The ensemble of backpackers and business types alike<br>
Who lined up for a chance to be around you<br>
Looking radiant, slender body bronzing on the sand
	</p>

	<p>
Utterly indifferent to everything around you.<br>
You regaled me with tales of escapades in Abu Dhabi,<br>
Europe, your work in Myanmar before the coup.<br>
All sounding so ordinary to you, the most special
	</p>

	<p>
Being the stories of your own town, humble<br>
Origins in Niigata that nobody would imagine,<br>
Just looking at you, ever the unwilling centre<br>
Of attention, it makes sense that
	</p>

	<p>
You chose to go as far as you could<br>
To get a moment’s peace,<br>
Brilliant breaking surf,<br>
Your own open stretch of beach.
	</p>

	<p>
I knew as I sat beside you that<br>
You had long since achieved escape velocity<br>
And you would soon be gone, a comet<br>
I am destined to see but once or twice<br>
In a lifetime.
	</p>

	<p>
I hope you remember the taste<br>
Of bogan Australia I gave you<br>
A cut of KFC chicken by the beach,<br>
Teasing the gulls with the chips
	</p>

	<p>
	  A slice of slower life
	</p>

	<p>
As you keep flying with the stars<br>
I, lying in a lonely field<br>
Admiring the long tail<br>
In your wake.
