      <h2>Liminal Encounters</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
	<p>
	  Corpses of creatures from other worlds<br>
Their flesh discoloured and<br>
Soon to slough off the bone<br>
	  Rarely make their appearance here
	</p>

	<p>
Where an obscure .docx file outlines who<br>
Should be called when they lie<br>
In the sand, motionless, gasping for air<br>
And which branch should appear
	</p>

	<p>
	  To meet them
	</p>

	<p>
But the folder was last touched in 2009<br>
And the branch has long fallen<br>
Back into the sea, we can only<br>
Forget and look in awe at those
	</p>

	<p>
Who have come alone, sick,<br>
To see us
	</p>

	<p>
One more time, before they fall back<br>
Primordial, into waters unknown<br>
Far beyond the warped reflectors<br>
Stuck askance, pointing at the
	</p>
	
	<p>
Barren stumps of our own<br>
Imagination
	</p>

	<p>
Lying still at the tide, flat<br>
Across the horizon, a broad<br>
Monolith backed by the violet<br>
Sun, and slowly cresting waves
	</p>

	<p>
The greatest of creatures,<br>
Magnificent even in death,<br>
Mamang, to go by the old tongue<br>
And trying so hard to find peace
	</p>

	<p>
	  In this world
	</p>

	<p>
Pushing out to the very barriers<br>
Of your range, beyond<br>
The survivable limit, the beach<br>
The Mount Everest of your kind
	</p>

	<p>
And a congregational place<br>
For the grimly curious<br>
Of ours, sentimentals who want<br>
Just one more picture of you
	</p>

	<p>
Flanked by the divers looking<br>
Like dots in your wake<br>
And I, too, came<br>
With camera
	</p>

	<p>
For this unfamiliar creature<br>
From another dimension<br>
But was lulled to silence<br>
By the ocean
	</p>

	<p>
And the familiarity<br>
Of the waves that have<br>
Nourished me since<br>
I was a pup
	</p>

	<p>
My home and your home,<br>
The same at the edge<br>
As you came to see us<br>
With time weary eye
	</p>

	<p>
And I looked back at you,<br>
My guest,<br>
If only to say goodbye,
	</p>

	<p>
Spectacular creature, even<br>
In death, even the dimensions<br>
In stat books and standard containers<br>
Cannot hold the immensity of
	</p>

	<p>
The privilege of seeing you<br>
Once, fading<br>
In a single lifetime,<br>
Describing the moment
	</p>

	<p>
Like fitting the rainbow<br>
In an Excel spreadsheet<br>
To think they would<br>
Harpoon you
	</p>

	<p>
Not long before I was born,<br>
To reduce you<br>
To a statistic, a number<br>
And gross tonnage, a Latin name
	</p>

	<p>
And carcass<br>
Haunting the GDP figures
	</p>

	<p>
	  True nature bleeding back into the sea<br>
Like the old rival, known only on video<br>
Until the child came floating into<br>
	  Japanese harbour, to the
	</p>

	<p>
Astonishment of onlookers<br>
A true creature of the dead<br>
And dread terror, the horror<br>
Of sailors the world over
	</p>

	<p>
And too strange to be believed<br>
Now looking unimaginably<br>
Small and weak, eldritch<br>
Creature of the depths,
	</p>

	<p>
Skin mottled and peeling,<br>
And eye perceiving passively<br>
The sunlight<br>
Of a strange world
	</p>

	<p>
The gawkers an uncoordinated<br>
Flock of krill, unsure<br>
What to do in the face<br>
Of transcendence
	</p>

	<p>
<span lang="jp">大王烏賊</span> ready to receive<br>
The funeral rites, as best we<br>
Comprehend them, being<br>
Offered up to the deep
	</p>

	<p>
	  Sky above
	</p>

	<p>
Where the winged animals wait<br>
For the smell of rotting meat<br>
A distant cousin to be returned<br>
To the expanding cosmos,
	</p>

	<p>
Our best telescopes suggest<br>
We can’t see it evenly<br>
And I can’t exactly say my focus<br>
On the eyes of dying creatures
	</p>

	<p>
	  Is impartial;
	</p>

	<p>
Passing aliens on the shore,<br>
The crescent moon rises by<br>
Their shadow, lone stranger<br>
Of the night, if I could speak
	</p>

	<p>
I would only say<br>
I am listening.
