      <h2>Without You</h2>
      <p>How did I not see the signs<br>
	The strain<br>
	The incredible pain<br>
	You must've felt deep inside.<br>
      </p>

      <p>I found you<br>
	Still hiding from the world<br>
	And took your hand —<br>
	Watching you grow and thrive<br>
	One incredible man.
      </p>

      <p>It was always within you<br>
	The charm, the confidence<br>
	The style and gregarious smiles<br>
	That made you who you were.
      </p>

      <p>It only took someone to see<br>
	For the world to bathe in your glorious light.
      </p>

      <p>And yet perhaps I briefly lost sight<br>
	If only for a moment —<br>
	Of the man inside.
      </p>

      <p>I blinked and<br>
	You were gone.
      </p>

      <p>And now I stare<br>
	At a world that has lost its edges<br>
	Without definition<br>
	Blank signs and colourless hedges
      </p>

      <p>I would have listened,<br>
	But in my blindness didn't ask<br>
	The question that could change everything.
      </p>

      <p>I would have listened, but I didn't see.</p>

      <p>The grasses and the trees<br>
	Whisper their hushed cries<br>
	And I am without<br>
	As I am within.
      </p>

      <p>Cold like the snow<br>
	On that winter day.
      </p>

      <p>I would stand with you again<br>
	But there is no ledge<br>
	And only nothing lies beyond
      </p>

      <p>The quiet hush is deafening</p>

      <p>Without your voice to drown it out</p>
