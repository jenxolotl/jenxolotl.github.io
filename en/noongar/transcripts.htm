      <h2>Transcriptions of Historical Noongar Language Documents</h2>
      <div class="content">
      <p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, records of the Noongar language were published in several books by early European explorers, settlers, and missionaries. These works have now been scanned and digitized and are widely available from the National Library of Australia, the State Library of Western Australia, and a handful of other institutions around the world.</p>

      <p>In the interest of making these documents more easily readable and searchable and also furthering my own Noongar studies, I have transcribed these scans by hand into a modern digital format. The text is presented as closely as possible to how it appears in the original books, with some minor corrections of obvious typos and other errors. Readers should be advised that these documents are presented as is, as historical documents, and should not be assumed to be authoritative; they contain some errors, the orthographies used differ from the modern standard Noongar orthography and from each other, and further research needs to be done on the language contained therein. I plan to write an essay on the qualities of the various sources at some point in the near future.</p>

      <h3>Matthew Flinders, <i>A Voyage to Terra Australis: undertaken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country, and prosecuted in the years 1801, 1802 and 1803, in His Majesty's Ship The Investigator, and subsequently in the armed vessel Porpoise and Cumberland Schooner. With an account of the Shipreck of the Porpoise, Arrival of the Cumberland at Mauritius, and Imprisonment of the Commander During Six Years and a Half in that Island.</i> 1814.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Flinders_Vocab.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This short extract from pages 65-67 of Flinders' record of his explorations of Australia contains the earliest wordlist of the Noongar language, recorded at King George Sound in 1801. The words recorded line up well with later records, and document the distinctive southern dialect of Noongar with its monosyllabic words.</p>

      <h3>Phillip Parker King, <i>Narrative of a Survey of the Intertropical and Western Coasts of Australia.</i> 1827.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/King_Narrative.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>Chapter III of the second Volume of the explorer Phillip Parker King’s Narrative of his Australian voyage contains a longer wordlist in the same area that Flinders visited, recorded twenty years later in December 1821. There is a good degree of agreement between Flinders and King, and though King’s wordlist contains several errors where Flinders recorded the correct word, most of his additional words recorded are also accurate. The chapter additionally contains a fascinating description of Noongar life and culture at King George Sound and of a friendly early encounter between Europeans and Noongar people, and as such I have reproduced the full chapter here.</p>

      <h3>Scott Nind, <i>Description of the Natives of King George’s Sound (Swan River Colony) and adjoining Country.</i> 1831.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Nind_Description_of_Natives.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This article, first published in the inaugural volume of the <i>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London</i> in 1831, was written by medical officer Isaac Scott Nind (c. 1797-1868), based on his experiences as part of the early military settlement near modern-day Albany between 1827 and 1829, and communicated to the journal by Robert Brown (1773-1858), of Brownian motion fame. It contains a wealth of anthropological information about the lifestyle of the Noongar people living around King George’s Sound at the time, and provides a unique early wordlist of their distinctive dialect.</p>

      <h3>R.M. Lyon, <i>A Glance at the Manners, and Language of the Aboriginal Inhabitants of Western Australia; with a Short Vocabulary.</i> 1833.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Lyon_Manners_and_Language.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This short article by the rather eccentric Robert Menli Lyon (1789-1874) was published in <i>The Perth Gazette</i> on consecutive Saturdays from the 30<sup>th</sup> of March to the 20<sup>th</sup> of April, 1833. While <q>containing many inaccuracies and much that was fanciful</q>, in the words of Noongar lexicographer, George Fletcher Moore, it was nevertheless one of the first concerted attempts by a settler to put the Noongar language into writing, and remains a valuable source to this day. Lyon learned a significant amount of the Noongar in this article from talking to the legendary warrior Yagan, while he was imprisoned on Carnac Island.</p>

      <h3>Thomas Braidwood Wilson, <i>Narrative of a Voyage Round the World; Comprehending an Account of the Wreck of the Ship “Governor Ready.” in Torres Straits; A Description of the British Settlements on the Coasts of New Holland, More Particularly Raffles Bay, Melville Island, Swan River, and King George’s Sound; also, the Manners and Customs of the Aboriginal Tribes; with an Appendix, Containing Remarks on Transportation, the Treatment of Convicts During the Voyage, and Advice to Persons Intending to Emigrate to the Australian Colonies.</i> 1835.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Wilson_Specimen.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>Surgeon T.B. Wilson (1792-1843) wrote a short specimen of about 150 words of Noongar as spoken at King George Sound, during his travels to Perth and the Sound in 1829. It is found in Appendix II of his book, which I have transcribed here. The narrative contains several words that were omitted from the vocabulary, such as <i lang="nys">muga</i> for water, and I will probably do a transcript of the narrative in the future.</p>

      <h3>George Grey, <i>A Vocabulary of the Dialects of South Western Australia.</i> 1840. 2ed.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Grey_Vocabulary.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This expansive work, by British Army Captain and explorer George Grey (1812-1898), later to become Sir George Grey, Governor of South Australia and New Zealand, was the first significant vocabulary of Noongar ever compiled, and remains an invaluable source of the language to this day. It includes useful information on dialectal variants as well as the grammatical inflection of the language, a feature that was often not recorded in later works. Grey’s <i>Vocabulary</i> was a major source used in the compilation of Moore’s comprehensive dictionary several years later. This edition is based on the second edition, published in 1840; the 1839 first edition is extremely rare, and I have never been able to locate a copy.</p>

       <h3>Charles Symmons, <i>Grammatical Introduction to the Study of the Aboriginal Language of Western Australia.</i> 1841.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Symmons_grammar.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This attempt at a grammatical description of Noongar, published in <i>The Western Australian Almanack for the Year of Our Lord 1842,</i> was the first of its kind and one of the earliest descriptions of the grammar of any Australian Aboriginal language. Created by one of the first of the infamous "Protectors" of Aborigines, Charles Symmons (1804-1887), it was constrained by Symmons unfamiliarity with the grammar of Australian Aboriginal languages, which differs significantly from European languages and the traditional Latin grammar model taught in English schools. Nevertheless, it managed to describe the grammar of Noongar in a level not matched in other sources, and he recorded many grammatical features that may otherwise have been lost to time, as well as providing invaluable examples of Noongar sentences.</p>

      <h3>George Fletcher Moore, <i>A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia; with Copious Meanings, Embodying Much Information Regarding The Habits, Manners, and Customs of the Natives, and the Natural History of the Country.</i> 1842 [1884].</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Moore_Vocab.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This dictionary, attributed to Moore (1798-1886) but really the culmination of the collective effort of multiple early settlers who took interest in the Noongar language, including explorer and future Governor of South Australia and New Zealand Sir George Grey (1812-1898) and the colony's official interpeter Francis Fraser Armstrong (1813-1897), set the benchmark for Noongar studies in its day and has remained the Noongar dictionary <i>par excellence</i> ever since, unrivalled in both breadth and depth of coverage. It was first published in 1842 as part of Moore's <i>Diary of Ten Years' A Settler in Western Australia</i>, and republished in 1884 in a poorly proofread reprint of that book, riddled with numerous typos. I have followed the formatting of the 1884 edition in my own version, while cross-checking and correcting errors using the original 1842 edition. I transcribed the Australian-English section of this dictionary in 2023; I plan to transcribe the English-Australian half sometime in the future. So far as I can tell, there is nothing in the English section that is absent from the Noongar.</p>

      <h3>Rosendo Salvado, <i>Memorie Storiche dell' Australia; Particolarmente della Missione Beneditta di Nuova Norcia, e degli Usi e Costumi degli Australiani.</i> 1852</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Salvado_Vocab.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>Reproduced here is Chapter XII of Bishop Salvado (1814-1900)'s account of his founding of New Norcia; it features a reasonable wordlist in two dialects said to be found to the north and east of the mission. The eastern dialect is easily recognizable as Noongar, while the northern dialect is very similar but also has some noticeably different words. It is a valuable record of the northern dialects of Noongar, and also, being written in Italian, provides a useful contrast to the English-based records of other observers, giving us a better idea of how Noongar actually sounded at the time.</p>
