      <h2>Transcriptions of Historical Noongar Language Documents</h2>
      <p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, records of the Noongar language were published in several books by early European explorers, settlers, and missionaries. These works have now been scanned and digitized and are widely available from the National Library of Australia, the State Library of Western Australia, and a handful of other institutions around the world.</p>

      <p>In the interest of making these documents more easily readable and searchable and also furthering my own Noongar studies, I have transcribed these scans by hand into a modern digital format. The text is presented as closely as possible to how it appears in the original books, with some minor corrections of obvious typos and other errors. Readers should be advised that these documents are presented as is, as historical documents, and should not be assumed to be authoritative; they contain some errors, the orthographies used differ from the modern standard Noongar orthography and from each other, and further research needs to be done on the language contained therein. I plan to write an essay on the qualities of the various sources at some point in the near future.</p>

      <h3>Matthew Flinders, <i>A Voyage to Terra Australis: undertaken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country, and prosecuted in the years 1801, 1802 and 1803, in His Majesty's Ship The Investigator, and subsequently in the armed vessel Porpoise and Cumberland Schooner. With an account of the Shipreck of the Porpoise, Arrival of the Cumberland at Mauritius, and Imprisonment of the Commander During Six Years and a Half in that Island.</i> 1814.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Flinders_Vocab.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This short extract from pages 65-67 of Flinders' record of his explorations of Australia contains the earliest wordlist of the Noongar language, recorded at King George Sound in 1801. The words recorded line up well with later records, and document the distinctive southern dialect of Noongar with its monosyllabic words.</p>

      <h3>R.M. Lyon, <i>A Glance at the Manners, and Language of the Aboriginal Inhabitants of Western Australia; with a Short Vocabulary.</i> 1833.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Lyon_Manners_and_Language.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This short article by the rather eccentric Robert Menli Lyon (1789-1874) was published in <i>The Perth Gazette</i> on consecutive Saturdays from the 30<sup>th</sup> of March to the 20<sup>th</sup> of April, 1833. While <q>containing many inaccuracies and much that was fanciful</q>, in the words of Noongar lexicographer, George Fletcher Moore, it was nevertheless one of the first concerted attempts by a settler to put the Noongar language into writing, and remains a valuable source to this day. Lyon learned a significant amount of the Noongar in this article from talking to the legendary warrior Yagan, while he was imprisoned on Carnac Island.</p>

       <h3>Charles Symmons, <i>Grammatical Introduction to the Study of the Aboriginal Language of Western Australia.</i> 1841.</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Symmons_grammar.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This attempt at a grammatical description of Noongar, published in <i>The Western Australian Almanack for the Year of Our Lord 1842,</i> was the first of its kind and one of the earliest descriptions of the grammar of any Australian Aboriginal language. Created by one of the first of the infamous "Protectors" of Aborigines, Charles Symmons (1804-1887), it was constrained by Symmons unfamiliarity with the grammar of Australian Aboriginal languages, which differs significantly from European languages and the traditional Latin grammar model taught in English schools. Nevertheless, it managed to describe the grammar of Noongar in a level not matched in other sources, and he recorded many grammatical features that may otherwise have been lost to time, as well as providing invaluable examples of Noongar sentences.</p>

      <h3>George Fletcher Moore, <i>A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia; with Copious Meanings, Embodying Much Information Regarding The Habits, Manners, and Customs of the Natives, and the Natural History of the Country.</i> 1842 [1884].</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Moore_Vocab.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>This dictionary, attributed to Moore (1798-1886) but really the culmination of the collective effort of multiple early settlers who took interest in the Noongar language, including explorer and future Governor of South Australia and New Zealand Sir George Grey (1812-1898) and the colony's official interpeter Francis Fraser Armstrong (1813-1897), set the benchmark for Noongar studies in its day and has remained the Noongar dictionary <i>par excellence</i> ever since, unrivalled in both breadth and depth of coverage. It was first published in 1842 as part of Moore's <i>Diary of Ten Years' A Settler in Western Australia</i>, and republished in 1884 in a poorly proofread reprint of that book, riddled with numerous typos. I have followed the formatting of the 1884 edition in my own version, while cross-checking and correcting errors using the original 1842 edition. I transcribed the Australian-English section of this dictionary in 2023; I plan to transcribe the English-Australian half sometime in the future. So far as I can tell, there is nothing in the English section that is absent from the Noongar.</p>

      <h3>Rosendo Salvado, <i>Memorie Storiche dell' Australia; Particolarmente della Missione Beneditta di Nuova Norcia, e degli Usi e Costumi degli Australiani.</i> 1852</h3>
      <a href="transcripts/Salvado_Vocab.pdf">PDF</a>
      <p>Reproduced here is Chapter XII of Bishop Salvado (1814-1900)'s account of his founding of New Norcia; it features a reasonable wordlist in two dialects said to be found to the north and east of the mission. The eastern dialect is easily recognizable as Noongar, while the northern dialect is very similar but also has some noticeably different words. It is a valuable record of the northern dialects of Noongar, and also, being written in Italian, provides a useful contrast to the English-based records of other observers, giving us a better idea of how Noongar actually sounded at the time.</p>
