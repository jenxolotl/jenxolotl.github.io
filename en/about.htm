	Hello everyone, welcome to my personal page!
      </p>

      <fig>

      <p>
	My name is Jenxolotl, also known as Jennifer Wattlebird, and I am a <s>walking, talking axolotl</s> lifelong resident of the beautiful state of Western Australia, one of the most remote and sparsely inhabited places on Earth.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	I was born in Rockingham, by the sea, and spent my early years up in Newman, surrounded by the gorgeous red and green colour palette of the Pilbara. My time up north has given me a lifelong love of the land, as well as a lived appreciation for the oft maligned desert regions of the world. I later moved back to Rockingham and here gained a love of the lakes and the oceans that surround me, as well as an apprecation for the ancient culture and knowledge of the Noongar, whose land I was born on.
      </p>

      <p>
	I have a deep love of Western Australia: the land, the community, and the culture; and continue in my quest to become the ultimate sandgroper.
      </p>

      <p>

      <p>
	I am a longtime student of Asian cultures and languages, and an advocate for improved understanding of Asia here in Western Australia, greater exchange, and a supporter of WA’s many multicultural communities. I consider myself very fortunate to have learned so much from friends here in Perth, across Asia, and around the world, and I’m thankful to all the people who have welcomed my interest in their languages and ways of life.
      </p>

      <p>
	I studied Asian studies and linguistics at university — before I dropped out — and still have an ongoing interest in these fields as well as history and anthropology. My current interests include Buddhist-Muslim interaction and the women’s movement in the Middle East.
      </p>

      <p>
	I am also a poet, a writer, and a photographer, and you can find some examples of my work on the pages of this website. Also on the site is my work on the life and poetry of Oscar Walters, a Western Australian bush poet of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, and some results of my research into the local Noongar language.
      </p>

      <p>
	In my free time I enjoy going on bush walks, trying new cafés and restaurants, obsessively snapping photos, listening to ’80s music and watching weird movies on SBS, going to WAFL games, hanging out with friends, meeting new people and generally... doing my own thing as much as I can.
      </p>

      <p>
	It’s the way to live!
      </p>
